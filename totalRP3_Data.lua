As such, she trained twice as hard when duty called for her - and it showed. \n\nClad in light-weight, magically infused plate armor, she carried herself with a sense of purpose. Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

She watched as some of her fellow Spellbreakers were sent to become demon hunters, but not her. She would stay to find somewhere where her husband and young son could have a new life, safe in this new world. \n\nBut her dream would not last. Kael’thas became addicted to fel magic, and joined forces with the Legion. She realised her people would never be safe while the legion existed, so she left. Fleeing the base in Netherstorm, she made her way across Outland to the Black Temple, where she went to find Illidan. She asked him for the power to prevent those she loves from falling to the Legion, and so she became one of the Illidari. \n\nAs typical with new recruits, she was taken out hunting. Finding a minor Doomguard, she engaged in battle, emerging victorious.  Cutting out its heart with her new glaives, she ate it with her fellow Illidari watching. Then her world fell apart.  \n\nShe saw countless planets being consumed by fire and fel, she saw cities burning as Infernals strode through them. She saw Silvermoon standing tall and proud, and then turning to ash. Her husband and son hiding in their home as a creature burst through the wall and slaughtered them without a thought. \n\nSoon she awoke, to a world of blackness and pain. She was told that she had torn her eyes out to hide the horrors, and was back in the temple. Her body felt different, stronger, tougher, faster. She felt horns on her head, and claws on her hands and feet. She was one of the lucky few who survived the initiation rites, and was now a full-fledged Demon Hunter. Soon she was able to see again, but everything was different. She saw almost as before, but more. More things were visible.  \n\nRealising she could never see her family again, she swore she would see the Legions end to keep them safe. ",

Sometimes, other slaves attempted to escape, managing to succeed or be cut down in the process; to Yaika the notion of escaping from this life seemed... Strange. \n\nWhere did those who escaped run to? For how long did they survive before being captured once more?\n\nWhen not being watched as strictly, she would converse with her fellow Vulperan slaves - they knew of a life different than this, one of hope, freedom, and though it was a struggle to survive, they lived lifes of their own, living together as family, their homes wherever the caravans lead them.\n\nAs Yaika came of age, these notions of a different life, one not defined by hopelessness and oppression became... Quite enticing.\n\nIt did not take long for her to escape - watching her captors, how they lived, where they went, it was as much her own life as it was theirs, and slipping free from her chains was less issue than she had thought.\nYaika was not used to life in Vol'dun as her kin were. She had never had to hunt for her own food, nor scavenge or find shelter, let alone defend herself. \nIt was no surprise she was recaptured quite quickly.\n\nTo Yaika now however, life had changed. She knew of the dangers of Vol'dun, of the thrill of survival from simply living by herself... \n\nThe rest of it came quite naturally, almost by instinct. It took mere weeks for Yaika to learn how to survive - she met her kin, and not just Vulpera, but all those in Vol'dun who did not live by the subjugation of others, who taught her not just to survive, but to thrive, despite the harshness of life. \n\nAdventure, survival, laughter, hardships, to her this was now life, and she was thankful for every moment. {/p}\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sandstorm:512:15}",

And Kemala is no different. Built like a literal bulldozer, this furry mostrosity of dense bone and powerful muscle will charge clean through any barricade and knock aside anyone standing in her way.\nDue to being mostly muscular with little fat, her chest and hips are not as defined. They are clearly feminin. But, not THICC.\n\nKemala has shaggy fur. Brown with beige spots and belly. Although, clean and well tended. The fur will remain coarse and shaggy. Her hooves are adorned with metal plates on the bottom. Hammered in with metal plate. Hoof irons.\n\nFacial features: \nKemala's blue eyes are set in a frown. Just the shape of her face really. Her snout is long, with large nostrils. Her teeth clean and white.\nHer black horns frame her features well.. Often used to knock aside those who don't get out of her way fast enough.\nShe has warpaint on her snout.\n\nHer brown mane is shaggy and ruffled. With a braid hanging down her torso.\n\nEquipment:\nPlate armor. The spikey iron is crude and primitive.\nMaintained often enough, it does show signs of battle. With scratches and broken off spikes.  \nThe armor is decorated with fur and feathers.\nA shield is strapped to her arm. The base is wooden, surrounded with a thick iron border.\n\nOn her hip she has what humans consider a large backpack. A pouch to Kemala. The fur, leathery satchel, decorated with feathers, is filled with equipment for travel. Rope, food, a waterskin, a skinning knife, a leather tent.\n\nShe carries spikey club with her.\n\nShe also carries a bow and arrows with her. The bow also made of kalimdor oak. The arrows made with stone tips, soft wood, and eagle feathers.\n{/col}{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TrollDrum:512:256}",

					["TX"] = "{h3}Description{/h3}\nStanding noticeably below the average height of his kind, this young man lacks the imposing image that most would be used to seeing. In stark contrast to brightly-coloured hair and commonly pale visage, he instead possesses dull auburn strands and warm, tanned skin.\n\nAlthough he shares the regal facial structure that elves are known for - pleasing to the eyes and at best deemed 'pretty' - there's an almost 'common' or 'average' element shown in his mannerisms and dress that waters it down. It is most likely that he, among his brothers and sisters, would be considered lowest in the hierarchy. In short, he looks nothing special and certainly doesn't act it, either.\n\nHis eyes, aflare with a jade green glow, are almond in shape and ever so slightly narrowed. A long, sharp nose with a faint, upwards tilt on the tip, thin, pinkish lips and high cheekbones hark back to the aforementioned, 'pretty' factor. No facial hair is seen other than the dagger-shaped tuft upon his chin, which appears to be intricately and regularly trimmed.\n\nPerhaps overgrown, but well kept hair is simply tied back and flows freely, allowing for shorter bangs to frame either side of his face and tall ears. A couple of rogue strands tend to fall forward and get in his eyes, which he habitually sweeps back whenever they misbehave. \n\nEven though one would argue that all elves are timeless in their looks, his age becomes apparent in the way he carries himself; inexperienced, polite and obedient to his betters, yet immensely curious. Regardless, he is well spoken, albeit somewhat relaxed compared to those higher than him. He appears to struggle to remain still and haplessly wanders in order to explore or experience new things.\n\nMore often than not, he will display qualities or perform actions that would be deemed 'alien' to natives, hinting at a lifestyle and training not regularly practiced or known. \n\nThe only item on his person that seems to have any significance or worth is an ornate-looking, golden coin of Pandaria origin, threaded and suspended through a square hole in the middle by a length of dark woven leather that hangs around his neck.\n\n\n{h3}Equipment & Inventory{/h3}\n\n-Rune Spear: Elegant yet practical, this spear with a glaive-like blade is clearly of High Kingdom design and enchanted with arcane runes to both keep it lightweight, but to also return to the owner on command if disarmed.\n \n - Collapsible Bo Staff: A simple-looking, ironwood staff reinforced with steel at either end. It can collapse to form a baton when not in use and is normally clipped onto the back of his belt.\n\n- Boot Knife: More of a tool or something used only when desperate, a small dagger is contained in a sheath normally kept on his right boot. The handle is carved out of a stag's antler, seeming a little worn.\n\n- Voice of Azeroth Pin: A small pin badge which is either attached to his belt, chest, tabard or front of his cloak depending on what he wears. It marks him as a member of the Voice of Azeroth movement.\n\n \nBag Contents:\n\n- Journal; leather-bound book with silver clasps.\n\n- Leather-bound sketchbook, pencils, ink, quill and charcoal.\n\n- First Aid Kit; bandages, gauzes and salves, a small sewing kit and small vials of alcohol, basic potions and antidotes.\n\n- Repair Kit; basic needle and thread for fabric and leather repair.\n\n\n{h3}Background{/h3}\nA young man trying to find his place in Azeroth, Erithur has endured many hardships in his - relatively short  - life, when compared to others of his kind. Despite this, he has endeavoured to carve out his own destiny; seeking adventure, fame and glory whilst relying on the training his former master had taught him to survive.\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/222858*AA Profile!}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-monk-cover:256:256}\n",

Perhaps not the intensely fit specimen that make up the large swathes of the people this woman hails from, but impressive to look at none the less, if for wholly different reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost among her features is the shape the woman carries. Far from made for hard physical labour, her body holds matronly proportions most apparent in her chest and waist, which sit above average among her kind. Even so, the orcess is not quite an elf or of their delicate proportions, and it shows in her more average waistline. Bar the claw-marks upon her right side, the orcess' skin is flawless, unbroken by damage where it can be seen.\n\nFurther still, the orc woman is no less a pleasant face to look at.  Gifted with rather graceful features for her kind, the orcess none the less retains somme of that hardy fierceness in her features that nigh on all orcs bear.  This is held most obvious in the mohawk of scraggly black hair atop her head, barely tamed down from a state of wild messiness.\n\nEven so, the orcess remains easy on the eyes, sporting a fine and soft pair of luscious green lips - a shade darker than her emerald skin - that sit low on her face. her natural expression lends her a small pout that is split by a pair of small yet no less intrusive tusks that jut out sharply, coupled with a pair of large and inviting pair of eyes that call for attention, holding a glint of curiousity. Her nose is soft and rounded in a way that only support the softness and matronly aesthetic that pervades the rest of her features.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{link*https://imgur.com/a/cKxRf1O*Art of Loruka!}\n{/h2}\n",

For those who might've known her before, she is somehow even colder, less responsive, walking around and dragging her feet. She is also -very- quick to anger now.{/col}\n\n{col:64ff79}Description and Everything Else{/col}\n\nShe is not your average Blood Elf, she is not lean but infact a fairly muscled, dangerous looking and overall quite an intimdating sight in height and width, but, this is all undermined with her general disconnected manner of being, she keeps herself in shape for some sort of misguided sense of duty, one she long failed.\n\n\nHer attitude can be quite infuriating, it is not that she does not wish to fight people, it is more the fact she finds no one worth fighting. Her arguements mostly directed towards fellow Blood Elves, or as she calls many of them Light'dorei, due to their golden eyes. If someone was to goad her into a fight then despite her poor look she would not be anywhere near easy to beat, she was a dangerous Elf, she just hid it better than the people who trounced around in full plate carrying two handed swords bigger than themselves.\n\n{col:ff4924}Face, body, other things.{/col}\n\nHas heavy black bags under her green eyes from a lack of sleep, or sleepless nights, this only adds to the grim coldness that has dominated her face, her skin lacks the same vibrancy of many other Elven folk being rather pale and drained of much colour, the most prominent example of her cold demeanour.\n\nBody wise she is fairly plain, bar the scars, marks, visible muscles and tattoo, overall not the worst to look at if you ignore her face, again her skin is pale around her body, despite being in the Durotar heat a lot.\n\nDoesn't carry a tonne of things on her, only really carries a handful of coins she somehow gets, probably via some menial labour, which explains how she keeps in shape, but someone would need to ask her to find out and she isn't telling.\n\n\n{col:fff374}Armour and her Relationship with it{/col}\n\nBe it for fighting or training, it would be something completely different to who she is, it showed off her size truely and made her look like a genuine threat to anyone and anything that stood in her way, the armour as black as night has had all emblems of Blood Knight origin scorn away but it retains a majesty that none other could compare to, she often wears her old, chewed tabard atop it, with a black-red belt wrapped around her waistline to bring the whole dark attire together.\n\nShe has another, very similiar attire, but this one is a long red-gold robe, topped with brown leather along certain parts to act as padding and reinforcement for weaker portions of the armour. This armour looks even more out of place upon her form, its golden and bright colours reflecting poorly with her pale skin, mixing this with the beaten nature of said armour does mix it into her general being very well.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nQuick overview of her personaility for people who make it this far;\n\nShe is not a nice person, she is cordial, that is true. Often polite in conversation, speaking softly and generally being open to discussion, debate and other such things of that nature, but, in the end she is a terrible, horrible person. Not psychotic, but not a Saint. She is no grinning, laughing maniac, she is a soldier who did her duty, with terrible calmness.",

Her family was one of mages, with a long history of studying the arcane arts, and she was no different. From a young age she was rather adept at magic, primarily pyromancy. A skill she still carries to this day. \n\nHer family resided within Suncrown Village in the land now known as the \"Ghostlands\". They were no stranger to the many dangers of the forest surrounding their home, specifically the Amani raiding parties which ravaged villages and encampments all across Quel'Thalas. Yet despite all the preparations in place as well as its defenses it simply wasn't enough, as one day a green tide swept over the young girls home. Silannia was crushed at the loss of her entire family that day, she lost everyone she had ever known closely, gone in an instant. \n\nFollowing this tragedy, she packed whatever small semblance of belongings she had left and moved to Silvermoon, where she lived in poverty for many years, barely scraping by. Her mental state would never fully recover from the loss of her family, and she turned to vices like peace bloom, quickly becoming an addict to it. Her reliance on the substance became a crucial part of simply managing her day to day routine. \nThe elf was shunned by anyone who found out about said addiction, to the point where she could barely be within the city without being ridiculed, as her form emaciated, she ended up spending nearly all her time outside the city walls in the seclusion of the Eversong woods. \n\nYears passed and her life remained relatively unchanged save for the introduction of one person. In the years after the loss of her family, she had grown familiar with another elf. She had been a blessing to Silannia, a much-needed sense of freedom for her head, as her thoughts finally could clear up. \n\nThis... Didn't last for long, strange rumors had emerged from Lordaeron, rumors of the dead rising from their graves. She as well as most of her kin scarcely paid heed to these whispers, Quel'thalas was protected, built to weather any army, undead or otherwise.\n\nSuch confidence turned out to be a fatal mistake. Quel'thalas was betrayed from within and once more Silannia saw what little she had desecrated and destroyed. The only one she had left, her lover, rose after being slain. She was forced to reduce her to ashes to relieve her of her torment. \n\nOn the day Quel'thalas fell Silannia's mind fell along with it. A crumbling vestige of her former, already meager, stability. The Quel'dorei were shattered, their resolve broken and what little remained of their Kingdom that escaped The Scourge would forever bear the scar of their suffering, carved into the land itself.{/col}{/p}\n\n{icon:ability_ironmaidens_corruptedblood:25}\n{h3}{col:ff705f}Blood Magic{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:c05b57}Following the destruction of Quel'thalas the Quel'dorei now named Sin'dorei turned to other means than the Sunwell for sustaining themselves Sil was no different, yet she did have other interests. She felt an alluring call to blood magic, the rare yet powerful magic was like a drug to her as she began to practice it. \n\nWhile her skill within the school isn't as good as her mastery over fire she is still rather adept at utilizing blood magic. \n\nJust how far she's taken her craft you'll just have to find out yourself! {/col}{/p}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/lryLzVd*Shadowlands Silannia!}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/RyC5AsG*ART!}",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

With a towering height and intensity and her blueish eyes that could intimidate an orc- E.J seems unaware of the power her looks have. And the looks she has; a beautiful shal'dorei even by the standards of elves- her long black hair and arcane tattoos both shine like moonlit silk, while her high cheekbones and full lips frame a face full of intensity and youth. By all means, a striking woman with the charm to go with it- it would take one much longer to realise just how capable she is of being truely terrible.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{p:c}{icon:spell_nature_wispsplodegreen:25}{/p}\n\n{h3:c}{col:75D897}Whispers around Suramar paint E.J as an eccentric; if they're polite, or utterly crazy if they're not. Inheriting a large house and gardens when her parents passed in childhood, and living as a ward of her rich noble aunt, she broke free of her control to do things her own way upon reaching adulthood. Her way appears to have ruffled some feathers, and she was rarely seen in polite society. She seemed to much prefer the company of fellow students of the arcane, those of lower class, and her veritable menagerie of animal companions.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{p:c}{icon:spell_nature_wispsplodegreen:25}{/p}\n\n\n\n{link*https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ejwy42KXsAAsOYi?format=jpg&name=4096x4096*E.J by @galgoblin on twitter}",

But after four years working different Mercenary jobs,\nHe eventually became a humble, kind and generous man who was quite very loyal to his employers and mercenaries. Even if they treated him with disdain.{/col}{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} A man of passion {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Due to his Lecherous nature, Xian is a man of passion and has easily fallen in love quite a lot.\nBecause of this, he is often easily wooed or taken advantage of by beautiful maidens who try to trick him into revealing secret information about those he works for or to just murder Xian when he’s not looking. He is also a ladies man who has married twice with four children.{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} Lack of Intelligence and cowardness {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Xian was quite the reject when he first came to the Eastern Kingdoms All those years ago. His stupidity and Cowardness was affecting missions And has often led his team into serious trouble. Tired of causing pain and misery to his friends he learned how to read common and  elvish languages and also learned how to fight and fend for himself against the burning legion at the time.{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} Story {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Xian was born to Sun-Wu the Captain of the village guard and his secret lover JinJing a maidservant to Ma Huateng  the village headman of Wu-Song.\n\nTo help his beloved avoid punishment, Sun-Wu agreed to raise their son away from the Huateng household.\n\nGrowing up in Wu-Song was quite tough because of recent Hozan attacks.\n\nAt 5 years, Xian was forced to train throughout his life for the heat of battle.\n\nAt 15 years, Xian aided his father and his guards in bringing them food and drink as part of his training. Some treated the boy with respect while some didn’t.\n\nAt 25 years, Sun was wounded by a Hozan chieftain but was saved by his son Xain who in turn killed the Chieftain with his father's sword. After this, Sun retired from being the Captain and settled down with his son.\nThree months later Jinjing was permitted to leave the household as often as she wanted to support her family.\n\nAt 28 years, Xian convinces his parents to let him go with the other Islanders to visit the world. His father, not trusting outsiders, was hesitant  at first, but agreed,  but his mother protested only to agree when she couldn't convince  Sun otherwise. \n\nWith a Hug from his father and a kiss from his mother he left with the rest of the pandaren for the eastern kingdoms.\n{/p}\n",

She clearly takes great pride in her appearance.\n\nUnlike most Elves, however, she is incredibly shy. It is not quite clear to why this is, but it may be likely due to past events. Eitherway, despite her shyness she will open up to people if they talk to her about interesting matters such as magic, history or current events! Tydaeis may be one to avoid beginning conversations at time, but she is not arrogant nor does she view others as \"lesser\" despite the typical sterotypes that Quel'dorei have.\n{col:ffffff}{/col} \n\n{h2:c}\"Behold!

He's a veteran of the first and second war. Worked as a blacksmith under forgemaster Volkan during the Orc Draenei War. However once the portal opened he was conscripted like everyone else and fought as a warrior.\nWas part of the raiding teams that destroyed the towns of Grand Hamlet, Sunnyglade and he took part in the fall of Stormwind.\nHe fought against the dwarves in Khaz Modan, and was part of the battle for Dun Modr.\nWas suppose to have join the siege for Lordaeron, but due to being under the command of Rend and Maim Blackhand, he, along with the rest of the Black Tooth Grin Clan, was sent to punish Gul'dan for leaving the Horde at its most critical moment.\nReturned to the Blackrock mountain, just in time for the final battle that resulted in the overwhelming loss of the Horde to the alliance. Retreated inside the mountain itself, where the clan spent years fighting the Dark Iron dwarves. \nWhen Garrosh offered amnesty to the Blackrock Orcs still living in the Burning Steppes, he took the oppertunity to leave. \nOpened up a successful shop in Orgrimmar, due to having learned the secrets of Dark Iron, and often traveled to the mountain to resupply. \nTook a mate, but due to his infidelity, she wanted to leave him, but she didn't want to break her oath, so he took it upon himself to fight at the Broken Isle, hoping to find death and release his mate from her oat. He was almost killed and presumed dead. Thus his former mate released herself from their bond.\nSpent the next months recovering in some field hospital, refusing the healing aid of the shamans, and then travelled back to the Blackrock mountain to practice his blacksmithing. He's now back in Orgrimmar, ready to start all over.\n\nFamily:\nWhen Demirgen was young, he fell in love with a young Warsong female. Knowing that he would probably join the rest of the Horde once the great portal had been constructed, he spent what time he could with her, not knowing that their passion left his lover pregnant. Only until decades later, would he discover that he had a daughter, Grashla.",

Once an orc came to the child's parents who offered gold for the child, the parents refused the orc ... The orc got furious and sucked blood from the orc's parents. The little orc looked and cried, orc took the child for 50 years, tortured them and tested his experiments on him. One day, not a small, strong orc got to know his name by his master, he can't speak orcish well. In the end Nomu because that was the name of the Orc defied the master, he cursed him saying \"Every week you have to sum up the blood of one creature or you will die ... And this will be your new froma disgusting mutant great orc, if you do well I will teach you turn into an ordinary orc. {icon:achievement_boss_twinorcbrutes:25}                              \nAfter months of good behavior, he learned to change into a normal orc, but the change hurts terribly, the master said \"Consume more blood, it won't hurt\". After long years of wandering with the master, they arrived in Tanaris where they were to spend the night there, Nomu fought in the arena, there he met a goblin who helped him kill his master ... Unfortunately, during the fight, Nomu died during the fight, Nomu despaired of the dead body of the goblin, finally headed to Orgrimmar.                               \nIn the orgrimmar he was looking for a job, he saw the job of a guard but they did not want to accept him saying that he had to practice the fight in the smaller form Nomu nodded and went to practice during training attacked him gank humans bantis. Nomu fiercely fighting killed 4 humans, the last 2 fled. After the fight, Nomu saw that the body of the blood elf was lying there, Nomu walked over to the body and noticed a two-handed sword in the hand of the dead elf. Runes were forged on the blade, the sword itself threw Nomu grabbed the sword and felt a sudden surge of energy, when 2 humans returned with the Worgen to help Nomu attacked the Worgen after a few blows with the sword Nomu aimed the sword at the Worgen and the sword fired a ball of blood.After the fight, Nomu returned home and examined the sword. The sword looked quite handy.Nomu decided to keep the sword for himself and use it for fighting\n{h3:c}End Of Story{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}Spells{/h2}\n{p:c}Transformation\n(WIP){/p}",

A pair of amber eyes sit confidently in their sockets with weak eyelashes that fan them. Thick and strong eyebrows rest above those. On his jaw and chin grows a patchy stubble, almost resembling a 5’o clock shadow. His lips, are almost evenly matched, his upper being slightly bigger than his lower. \n\n\nKeeping his head high and mighty is his thick neck, which is attached to his thick torso. Broad shoulders, a set of strong arms, a narrow waist and powerful legs. He is a solid mass of lean muscle with almost no fat to detect. \n\nThe Bleeding Hollow is war-mad, and both high-spirited and quick for battle, although otherwise simple and not ill-mannered. Guhlen is an eccentric and joyful Orc with bizarre and zany air about him. He is sincere and loyal to his kin and friends, often respected for his  sharp intellect and wisdom at such a young age. \n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-AncientShamanHeaddress:512:256}",

The knitted chainmail is made out of elementium rings and enchanted with lightweight runes and glyphs, visible by the glowing green bits of her armor. The nature of elementium makes the armor almost unbreakable. With such a big advantage, there always comes a similiar big or even bigger disadvantage. The rather large knitted elementium rings are easily bypassed by thin, pointy weapons like daggers. Even arrows could bypass it, if aimed perfectly. The best way to hurt her are probably blunt weapons and magic. Sharp and pointy only works if you come close enough to her, or you are a sharpshooter.\n\n{col:ff0c19}Red-Black Leather-Mail{/col}: The armor she wears mostly in hot and arid zones. Not as protective as the others since it is pretty revealing by showing most of her belly and arms, yet the protected parts are still well protected.

					["TX"] = "The beginning:\n\nHe was a nobody. No name he could remember, no home, just a dirty street kid that roamed the rich and noble city Silvermoon for scraps and work.\nSomethimes, the magister took him in with eagerness, their \"shady\" shipments needed careful handling. No one should ever let magic handle such fine crates.\nThe pay for such work was meager in comparison, but it gave him renown in Silvermoon's underground, as well as something to eat.\nNot the best life, but it was manageable.\n\nThat was, until he met \"her\". \n\nOne day, after he was tired from all the heavy crates, his now developed body ached for a bath.\nAnd a bath it was. He knew Eversong forest like his own pocket. \nIt was the dawn of the day, when he went into the woods, found his little secluded pond and took off what little he had on him.\nNothing worth of stealing anyway... So he thought, and went in the cool water, groaning in pleasure.\n\nA nobody, submerged in water of a clean pond at dawn.\nLittle did he know, when he had enough bathing, and tried to swim towards the shore, something glistened in the water. It was white, dazzling, and simply too alluring to pass up on.\nDiving, he got into the small hole in the rocks, and there he saw the most beautiful flower. Or was it glass? Nothing of this world, that much he was sure of. And it was not rooted, it simply floated serene and pulsated to the distant dawnlight.\n\nSubmerging, the nobody was now holding a celestial rose,, completely unfit for his status, which the citizen of Silvermoon loved to remind him about.\n\"I guess you don't have a name too?\",he wondered and looked at the glass- like white rose. It shined as white as the clearest moonlight.\n\nMesmerized by the beauty of that rose, he swam to the shore and stashed the little flower away in his lunchbox. Sturdy, littered with locks and of good white steel.\n\"I guess, now i will have luck, hmm?\", he asked the lunchbox, just as he heard rustling in the bushes.\n\nJust as he wanted to grab whatever he had to defend himself, he remembered he never could afford the fee for fighting lessons. Not even a dagger was his, as those were too overpriced in the arrogant and rich city.\n\nWorrying about the price of being able to fight, all this time, someone emerged from the bushes.\nIt was \"her\". Lady dawnlight, as he now will forever call her in his mind. The most dazzling noble High elf he ever saw. The dawnlight was shining on her as if to praise her beauty. Her bow, adorned with gold and the best wood and feathers of Eversong, she looked at him. Never has he seen a female elf of nobility. Everything of her garments screamed noble family.\nEven her face, seeing the unknown toned man, naked and talking to his lunchbox, her distinguisehed face distorting only for a moment.\n\nNo one could blame her, right? But she was clearly in the wrong of stalking him like an animal, not noticing the clothes and human leads.\nJust raising an eyebrow, she simply said: \"My arrow will always find its mark, dirty street rat! Get out of my sight this instant!\"\n\nHer words just left her lips, and both knew, how incredibly stup{col:794930}{/col}id those sounded. Like he could not go anywhere...\nAngry at her blunder, she turned on her heels, and went back where she came from. No name, no introduction to her purpose of \"visit\", only a raised eyebrow...\n\nThe young elf was completely stunned. First that celestial rose, now that celestial beauty. Was that rose the reason she came? He did not realize he was still naked and stunned, he simply knelt in front of his lunchbox, and wondered how she knew he was a \"street rat\". He just had a bath, right? He must look pleasing now! *maybe*...\n\nHe sighed, and packed up to get back to the city and find a place to sleep, as he heard the familiar rustling again. The celestial beauty crawled out of the bushes again, and saw him again in all his might. \nThis time, there was no eyebrow raising, simply a scream and a boot to his chest.\nFalling back and groanin in pain, he fell back in the water. Submerged, water went into his mouth, lungs and he was panicing. Flailing in the water, dry drowning, the celestial beauty realized, she blundered again. She would kill him if she did not help....\n\nGnashing her teeth, she threw away her bow, landing on the lunchbox of that strange man. Another splash was heard, and the noble woman was submerged, and skillfully swam sideways, holding the coughing young elf in her embrace, trying to get him onto shore.\n\nThe next thing he could ever remember was.... fire. Reddish like dawnlight, it glistened in his tired eyes. Her butt in front of his sight, he was slowly regaining control of his thougts and memories. Quickly getting up, and coughing, trying to bow to the noble lady...\nHe landed  face first in the dirt in front of her.\n\nHearing her groan of his misdemeanor, he got up, dirty face and stuttered a greeting. Not knowing his name, nor hers, it was pretty court.\n\"Stop it, i feel tired already seeing you...\",she said weakly. She did not know why she stayed, watched over him and kept him warm with magical fire...\n\"Whatever, you are fine now. Go back to your house!\", she said courtly. \n\nHe knew if he dared to look at her again, she would go bonkers and kick him again, so he was kneeling and keeping his gaze down, the last rays of dawnlight dwindling to give in to the night.\n\"yes, i will lady....\", the young man said. \"but.. i don't have a house. Didn't you call me street rat?\", he said, slightly confused looking up.\nHis innocent gaze totally riled her up and made her blush in embarrasment. \"I...it was a figure of speech! I call everyone streetrat that dares to show me such a dirty ...\" \n\"But my body was washed?\", did the young man incur.\n\"Shut it or i'll totally have you swallow the whole pond!\", swore the lady, getting more red in the hue of the campfire. \nThe young man sensed her peril, and kept his mouth shut. He looked around, and found his lunchbox, still tightly sealed. Grinning, he stood up, and the blanket he had on his body fell down, revealing his naked body, again.\n\"ehh?\", he was a bit embarassed now... Why was he naked under an unknown blanket? DId she..\n\"I did not find your clothes, and you would not want mine, or get them in a lifetime.\",she said courtly, but this time taking more time to look at him. He was really muscular.... \"NONONO, NO!\", she said to herself, completely trying to banish those thoughts out of her head.\n\"An..anyways\",she calmed herself, watching him change, in front of her. She kind of got used to seeing his body, and for him shame was something he probably doesn't even have. \"First time i saw a male naked.\",she joked. Of course not,but the boy got red and stumbled putting on his pants... it was too adorable for her.\n\n\"so, whats your name, faceplanter?\",she asked, giggling. She enjoyed teasing him, for no reason.\n\"i have none\", he said, slowly. He accepted her tease, because she was goodlooking and.. he did faeplant twice in front of her. Falling down with crates was the worst, the screams and curses of the employer were .... but her teasing was kind of worse. He didn't want her to think he was weak.\n\"Oh? Why is that?\", she asked, but kinda knew why. Seeing him staying quiet at her question, she simply smiled. \"it's getting dark, get back to the city.\",she said, donning her clothes and gear.\n\"what did you even want here? Stalking me trough the bushes..\", the young man asked suddenly, making her halt and stumble. \"Don't you dare think i did that to look at your disgusting weak body!\", she said, running up to him and punching him in the chest with her finger. It kind of hurts, but he tried his best to squeeze a confident smile, what in turn irrtated her more.\n\"I simply was told, here was a beast that needs to be slain, for the safety of the city\",she simply said. She turned around, not giving him anymore thought, and striding the streets to silvermoon. He did follow her, steps behind, and stayed in the shadows, seeing the guards bow at her, deeper than he even could. The look of hate they showed him, even after he got out of the shadow only 5 minutes after she disappeared.... She must be someone important? He found a ditch in the city, where it was warm and dark. \"Sleep.. i need sleep...\"the young man thought, using his lunchbox as a pillow.\n\n\nHis days were spent as usual. Working the crates, getting kicks by the dozen, only a couple that tried to pin an affair on him was the only unusual. Of course, the young man matured. Met many friends, female short lived pleasures, but always carrying his lunchbox at his side. No one could look into it. And he did not open it. Not once.\n\nOccasionally he would think of her,  the one at the lake. It seemed the white rose didn't give him special powers. He was quite good at fighting with a sword, but it didn't give him much praise from the magically inclined Sin'dorei.\n\nAll was fun and games, until \"he\" came. \n\nArthas.\nPlunging his blade in Lady Sylvanas, resurrecting her into a banshee, all of Silvermoon was in an uproar. Emergency conscripts were issued, all hands that could hold a blade should defend what little will be left of Silvermoon.\nThe now mature and indifferent looking young man was last to be conscripted. Even in  the darkest of times, honor, titles and nobility got you in the ranks first.\nfighting the last defense of Silvermoon was hard. Everything seemed to be lost. His blade, a dull old thing from the storage room... could only shatter bones and itself. His shield, an old wine barrel, could only take so many claws and bites.\n\"will this be over, will this be... Our last dawn?\", the young man asked. He hoped to gain a name, ending this scourge invasion.... but nothing.. Hit upon hit, his scrap gear got more scrap. He tried retreating from the invasion, but only a small clearing remained. Broken houses, ash like earth, beauty and destructon in one picture. There, it should be. His last hideout. His... lovely memory.... of her.... and the white rose.\nHe wanted to see it a last time. The beautiful sheen. The first beauty, that ever belonged to him. The first.... glow of dawn...\n\nCRASH!\nFalling trough the loose wooden planks, he landed upon his stash. The now old looking lunchbox... His bleeding hands touching it, hugging it... He heard the grunts and screams above. His... people dying. So will he, and the sunwell....\nFumbling with the rusty locks, he got it open. Just when he was about to open it, he heard her. The voice, he kind of longed for. \"One....last time, one last look, would not be bad...\"he thought. He crawled out of the hole, towards the voice\n\"keep it up! We still can fight!\". There she was. In the midst of a small group, dying and retreating. Rallying their spirits, but they were broken. Her optimism was... not as infectious as the scourge.\n\"guys, just a little bit more!\", she screamed, holding her last member of her group, loosing its sheen in his eyes.\n\"Looks like dawn is our time\", a confident, strained voice was heard. She got out of her stupor, looked up and saw a bloody, but still handsome, mature male elf, garbed in dirty rags and an teasing , but strained smile.\nShe did not know why, but... her smile came back.\n\"street rat!\", she screamed, kicking the ghoul that wanted to get her finally away, running to him. Always on her mind, he was nowhere to be seen. It was her fault, she should have mentioned her name.... she should....have.\nAfter getting back, her up and coming family wanted to finally get past the last hurdle to nobility. Her, being single, was the last hurdle. \nSeeing the many noble suitors, she simply could not hold it anymore, and chose to enlist.\n",

He joined up with the horde soon after as a mercenary and adventurer, doing oddjobs and hunting alliance foolish enough to set foot in the dunes of his homeland or other enemies foolish enough to attack the Horde. During his stay in Ogrimmar he was beset upon by assassins that wanted him gone and out of the city, he ran to the undercity ruins and was plucked up by the Bloodmark, a loyalist group that offered him amnesty in exchange for loyalty. Feeling grateful and disappointed in the horde he joined them, he lived with them, fought side by side with them. But eventually the leader was killed, and the group disbanded, now left to his own devices he made his way back to Zul'Farrak and made offerings to Gahz'rilla,offering him the sword and  in turn receiving blessings from the Demigod. Afterwards he turned his eyes towards the criminal underworld and now works as a mercenary and outlaw in the various neutral ports where ''safe haven'' is atleast able to be bought.

As she passes by the scent of fresh pine and wet grass shortly hangs in the air.\n\nBefore fading from view she halts ,turns and momentarily peers in your direction. A nearby light now revealing a worried expression. Deep emerald eyes glisten in the flickering light as they remain fixed on you, not a fibre of her being moves while she seizes you up. After a few seconds pass the figure lets out an almost inaudible sigh and relaxes somewhat, curling the right side of her lips into a faint, almost apologetic, smile followed by a short nod.

Should one catch him without his armour though, one would find several stab- and shot wounds marring his torso and legs.\n\nPekun's ear-cuff is concealing a sizable hole where a chunk is missing from his right ear. This is obviously the only scar he is actively trying to hide.\n\n\nHis armor is usually kept in good shape. The unobtrusive necklace, sporting several large teeth and claws, that dangles around the Goblin's neck, as well as his single nose piercing, are the only jewellery he wears (aside from his ear-cuff).\n\n---\n{icon:ability_racial_bestdealsanywhere:30}\n{h2}Personality & Quirks{/h2}\n\nPekun tends to call people descriptive nicknames instead of using their actual ones.\n\nHaving spent most of his days as a neutral merc, he doesn't have a lot of faction pride for the Horde. But he's fiercely loyal to his friends and will go through hell and high water to defend them; be it against physical harm or merely verbal offences.\n\nLike many goblins, what Pekun lacks in physical size and strength, he makes up for with his ingenuity. Which is why his spear is modified to increase it's effectiveness especially against larger targets. He loves to tinker, especially when faced with a problem that needs to be overcome. One of the results of this are his patented one-time-use rocket-propelled mail-chickens.\n\n---\n{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled03:30}\n{h2}History{/h2}\nAsk ic ;)\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Wetlands:256:128}",

One of average height amongst his kin, but rather toned in his build. His fur is that of a light shade of brown, acting as an effective camouflage in the dunes. A welcomed coincidence, considering this one excels in the art of subtlety. Many scars decorate this Vulpera's body, leaving some areas of his fur patchy. He carries these scars as a testament to his hardyness, as well as showing the harsh lifestyle that comes with the dunes. His most outstanding of them all being the burn on his face. One of venomous origin, the fur around his left eye has entirely been burnt as a result of potent venom, additionally blinding the eye too.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:000000}His attire is one fitting of a dune dweller. A light-weighted outfit following a tribal theme. Amongst cloth bindings and leather padding, many charms, feathers and bones decorate this one's self. Many belonging to his past prey. Anko's belt holds many tools and tricks at the ready for him to use in combat, allowing him to turn the tides in his favour, though many of them could be questionably dishonourable. Finally, two blades rest on each side of his waist. Crude in appearance with simple leather wrappings around the hilt. Whilst they show wear from their years of service they remain as sharp as the day the left the grinding stone. A layer of poison constantly lines them, making them the true definition of being poisonblades.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:000000}Anko's personality is a rather tricky one to pin point. At first glance, he seems to be a sour, stubborn fox. A cold, stern expression that looks as if he's staring daggers at you. He finds most untrustworthy, especially those of his kin that have chosen a different path to leave the dunes. Most of the time, he'd not give most people the time of day, usually dismissing those he deems uninteresting. Those he -does- find himself affiliated with, may reveal a suprising change of personality. Whilst he comes across aggressive and irritating, Anko finds great amusement in getting under the skin of those he interacts with it, usually all at the expense of others, making those who're sensitive and easily ruffled up have a hard time putting up with him. Despite it, however, his intentions only mean well.{/col}{/p}\n",

I just hope he's an okay character!{/p}\n\n{h3:c}Character summary:{col:d12c00}{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}A hoity, conservative Sin'dorei who has just reached \"mature\" age (aesthetically, around 30; 133 years in actuality). He's a soldier who has only recently started residing in Orgrimmar, offering his assistance to aide the Horde during the Fourth War. He still needs time to adjust to the wide array of different cultures - right now, he comes off as a priss and an ignorant, sheltered bigot. Perhaps this is all to compensate for his lineage; he hopes his human ancestry is unnoticeable, though his ears are a fair bit more compact than the typical Sin'dorei.\n\nTo compensate for his attitude, he makes for a decent Blood Knight, providing some use in both healing and fighting on the field; his Libram is his preferred weapon, preferring the use of knowledge to brute force, even though he is not as tactful and eloquent as he thinks he is. He always laments to himself about how he would have preferred to be a bookish Magister. And even though he sounds judgemental, he does not discriminate when it comes to healing the injured.\n\nAnd though he is trying to adjust to life in Orgrimmar, he still tries to stay true to his noble roots. It's difficult not to find Goblin slang amusing, however.\n\nIn the end, he is here to fight for the same reason as everyone else: a promising future for his people, the next generation - for his far-away daughters, especially. You might see him reading a letter with awkward handwriting from time to time.{/p}",

What this means is that she's surly and grumpy but dedicated to her task of being a front-line medic. And whilst she won't necessarily put people in harm's way, she considers mortal wounds a very good lesson on why you don't act stupid on the battlefield. \n\nAnd you bet she remembers that one time you stood in the fire and didn't move because you didn't want your damage to suffer: she especially remembers that bit, and will remind you at every occasion until you say sorry.\n\nShe's not only skilled in her role as a medic, but also trained officially as a monk and uses chi to compliment her skillset. She also uses it to abuse pressure points if people annoy her.\n\n{h2}Combat{/h2}\nWhilst she frontlines as a healer, Parylla's been trained as a Monk and lives up to the mantle. Parylla's fighting style revolves around patience, dodging attacks and redirecting weapon strikes without trying to negate the force. She strikes when vital spots and vulnerable moments arise, infusing a sudden torrent of Chi into her fists and feet so they strike with alarming, brutal force. Should she faced armoured or tough enemies, this strategy provides incredibly effective. Like a mace against plate, the force usually causes great internal damage at the very least. As an added bonus, she expends the Chi through her strikes so it permeates through armour and protection and directly affects the pressure points in question. Much less effective against shields, where she usually uses Jade Lightning to conduct and hopefully electrocute them.",

An able troll warrior, he is capable of wearing a variety, and mixture of light cloth and heavy plate armor with few limitations to his endurance and movement, providing ample defense, with which he can lash out with nimble strikes, making him capable of acting swiftly in combat, to avoid attacks or suddenly lash out to strike with his savage ferocity and rend his foes with swiftness and ease, to avoid or sustain injuries minor or geat.\n\nHis face is a rather plain one, strong and sleek cheekbones giving his cheeks more unique features to that of his kin. His long and lean chin seemingly well toned with his long nose, its thin bridge, cheekbones and his puddy pale lips. A pair of cyan blue spheres shines with a glisterning cunning and awareness outward to observe his surroundings, while a pair of ivory tusks germinate forth from beneath his sleek cheekbones, extending downward and then forth in a steep curvature infront of his visage.\n\nThick locks of burgundy red hair sprouts from his head, braided with crude golden rings, reaching down far to the upper reaches of his back, styled in a crude shaggy manner. Trailing down his ears are a half dozen golden piercings pierce the skin and dotting the spine of his long, thick ears, offering a horrifying, grim and barbaric appearance to most races of Azeroth.",

Trautfizzle{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-TheMotherlode:256:256}\n{h2:c}Profile By Skinkzey Nutwrencher{/h2}\n{h3:c}(Sponsored and edited by Jastor Trautfizzle){/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}Appearance{/h1}\n\nJastor Trautfizzle has changed over the years. His eyes were once red, his body lean and athletic from spending hours at work in his doctors surgery, and after a time where his eyes were green and his body less than athletic, it seems that life with the Bilgewater Battalion has given him muscle to match his bulk and he's even made consciencous effort to draw away from corruption. Aside from his eyes, his head seems to have taken the brunt of the toll which comes from dabbling in the fel, his face being more wrinkled and what was once a full head of hair having fled the top of his head, forming into sideburns which he struggles to keep in check. \n\nHowever, concerning his fashion sense <The next part seems to have been edited heavily> Jastor is a pioneer in good fashion sense, from his black battle ensemble with felforge ventilation to the finery which he wears when interacting with other important people, or attending fanciful functions, the problems brought about by AGING seem to slip away thanks to the Doctors impeccable style choices.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WorkshopHorde:512:256}\n\nI come from humble beginnings. Back on Kezan I lead the simple life of a Doctor after I graduated from Crapopolis U. I lived in Bilgewater Port out of my very own surgery with my family, who I unfortunately had to sell to the insurance company so that I could get tickets aboard Gallywixes Pleasure Yacht because Mount Kajaro went and blew its top whilst I was operating.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-LostIsles:512:256}\n\nHere's a holiday snap I took of the Lost Isles, ok so it was more of a traumatizing shipwreck in which I was attacked by wild animals, almost zombified by pygmies and temporarily enslaved by the Trade Prince but I got to say, the island was beautful. Until it got melted by another volcano...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n\nFor a while after the Lost Isles fiasco, I decided following the Trade Prince who had just enslaved me a week or so ago wasn't really for me. So I ran away with the Darkmoon Faire and learnt myself some warlockery. At first it was just an act, pull the imp out of a tophat, saw a voidwalker in two, but then it became something else, it became a -passion-.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Azshara:512:256}\n\nI've ended up saddled with the Bilgewater Cartel, again. It turns out that carnies don't take kindly to my response to their FALSE accusations being to give them the old finger and fly off in their dirigible. Of course they didn't really expect a guy who was once a fully qualified doctor (I still am by the way), to roll up dressed as a mad scientist. So they assigned me somewhere, let's just say my time in Azshara was short lived as it turns out 'they don't want their lumber turned into charcoal', ingrates...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Felwood:512:256}\n\nWhere did I end up? Felwood of course, where else would a Goblin warlock of my talents end up but in the back end of nowhere surrounded by the remnants of a once great empire of treehuggers and hippies, hidden away from the rest of the world to do my work.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-FelForge:256:128}\n\nBut don't you worry, ladies and gentlemen, the good old doctor still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and in this little pocket of fel infested paradise, my final trick is already in the making...",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

This stems from a desire to not fail again and die a second time. She sees any show of overly positive emotions or loss of control of happiness as distracting and frowns upon such a display, though it is safe to assume that she feels jealous for the person who is able to express themselves better than she can.\n\nAru’naere is a stern individual who values loyalty to commanders as the highest of regards. In her case, her zealous service to the Dark Lady, Sylvanas Windrunner, has often been a concern for both the living, as well as some undead. Aru’naere doesn’t believe in anything else and claims to exist only to serve the Banshee Queen. As such, she is terrible with taking orders from others who are currently her superior. \n\nThough she executes each order given to her, the moment she perceives a command as a hindrance for the Dark Lady, she speaks her mind or refuses to execute the order. Much to the annoyance of her companions, who sometimes regard her as stubborn and overly zealous. Some went as far that her loyalty is as strong as a Scarlet Crusader’s faith in the Light if not worse.\n\nDespite all this, Aru’naere is a calculated and generally reserved person. She is a stern leader and precise tactician, who is not afraid to achieve her goals by any means necessary, even if it means sacrificing some of her comrades. Overall, she is calm and not afraid to speak her mind. But she also knows her place in the Horde and finds some respect for others and their position, even if she doesn’t agree with them all the time.\n\nDue to her age, Aru’naere is well versed in lore and history, with a wealth of experience to draw upon. This makes her a good leader but thanks to her political views, not the best person to get advice from. Her leadership style is firm and sometimes brutal, seeking out the boundaries of her companion’s skill and expertise. \n\nShe knows what she commands, but is not afraid to throw her subjects into elements that aren’t completely fitting their role. Going for more unorthodox methods rather than conventional ones. Aru’naere has little concern for the safety of her companions, finding that the mission objective, especially when given by the Dark Lady, is more important. This makes her disliked among younger adventurers, but beloved to veterans and employers who respect her bravery.\n\nAru’naere is a firm follower of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows, taking its lectures to heart, she can sometimes be heard preaching about the virtues and how to handle them. Though her view on these virtues often go into the extreme, she has made an example of each of them and is considered as someone who uses the art of war paired with her believes. She is tenacious, power-hungry, loyal, and not afraid of death and shows respect to those that are part of the cult. She shows little interest in those who follow the counter-opposite of the Shadow; Light and condemns their virtues even though they can be regarded similar to her own.\n\nThough she never really shows it, Aru’naere actually hates her condition of being undead, finding no rest in her existence safe for her ability to serve the Dark Lady. She sees undeath as a curse but has no issue raising the dead if they can serve a purpose. She is jealous of the living and those that die of old age rather than on the battlefield. Though she will never openly admit this. Her loyalty lies with the Dark Lady and she tolerates the presence of the other races of the Horde.{/col}\n\n{icon:INV_Misc_Book_05:25}{col:88ff3e} - Background{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Aru’naere was born into a prestigious family of high-elven rangers who made their home within Windrunner Village, shadowed by the impressive Windrunner Spire, in the far western lands of what is now called: The Ghostlands. She is the firstborn daughter of Turonal and Sele’mari Winterfall, and as such, she was the heir to the heirloom weapon: Quel’thas. \n\nFor as long as she can remember, she has been trained in the arts of archery, tracking and other attributes tied to high-elven rangers at the time. When she became of age, she was sent to the capital city to further enhance her studies. Her lectures were nothing out of the ordinary, like many, she had her strengths and weaknesses, but she graduated nonetheless with ease and enlisted into the ranks of the Farstriders not long after her graduation was complete.{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff}She didn’t enjoy the rank of Farstrider very long, however. It was during the times when she just joined, that the evil king Arthas Menethil, better known as the Lich King, commanded his vast undead armies into the holy kingdom of Quel’Thalas. Because she was stationed in the capital, she was never able to rescue her parents from death and her younger sister Alenore was believed dead as well, for her body was never found.\n\nIt would only be years later that she learned that Alenore had survived but was a member of the Alliance as a High Elf. Aru’naere fell in the defense of Quel’Thalas and like many of her kin, she has risen as undead in service of the Dark Lady.\n\nBy the time she had freed herself from Arthas’ grasp, she joined her former Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner and was one of the first that became a Forsaken. Her loyalty to the Dark Lady became more firm as time went on until the point where she could think of nothing else. \n\nShe has seen almost every major conflict in recent years, gaining favor among allies, but also mistrust from others. Though she remains mostly in the shadows, in recent times, she can be seen more often in the open. Showing herself among the living more frequent in a silent attempt to gain more information and perhaps even trust from her allies.{/col}\n\n{icon:VAS_AppearanceChange:25}{col:88ff3e} - Appearance{/col}\n{col:ffffff}With a near-perfect symmetry to her facial features, which was common among the high elves of Quel’Thalas, Aru’naere can be described as an exceptionally beautiful individual, were it not for her undead condition. Thanks to the age of her death, her living features have dwindled by a little, but she retains most of the distinct elven qualities many of her kin have. \n\nTo onlookers, she must have been in the prime of her life, making it hard to decipher her exact age. Her almond-shaped eyes, which at one point showed the marine colors of the arcane and the natural iris of sky-blue, have now become a deep, blood-dyed red that may inspire intimidation to some. Her irises are decorated with the distinct crimson glow of a banshee, adding further to her undead appearance. Her long eyelashes are still easily visible to many who get a closer look at her orbs of observation.\n\nAbove her eyes rest two thin, long eyebrows which appear to be neatly trimmed, giving the impression that she still takes care of her looks to some degree. Their dye is the same pale, sandy-blonde as her hair. Her nose is of a small size and slender with a tad curve upward at the tip, common among the elves of the high kingdom, which only compliments to her facial beauty. Aru’naere sports relatively high cheekbones, which gives an enticing detail to her visage complimented nicely with her soft looking chin. Her lips are thin and lack many colors, the full, healthy-looking pink that they once had, has been stained with a slight ashen-grey hue with a dry complexion. {/col}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}Overall, these features give Aru’naere a nice but stern looking face, often cursed with a dead-serious expression that some would call ‘the face of a mother with a dagger behind her back’. Finishing off this look is her elegant, long, sandy-blonde hair. What was once silken soft and sumptuously thick, has now become thin strands of loose hair, but she doesn’t show any loss of it. This swathe of elven tresses reaches just above her back beyond the nape of her thin and enticing neck. An extra detail is the parted fringe of long strands of hair that decorate both sides of her face, reaching to just above her chin.\n\nBeing of highborn stock, she towers above many of her common kin, reaching beyond six feet in height with a great amount of that height attributed to her long and slender legs. Aru’naere’s figure is voluptuous, with ample amounts of flesh in all the most enticing places. A trade she kept even beyond death. Though it is often not seen thanks to her clothing, Aru’naere’s muscles are delicately shown in her slender arms and legs, as well as on her stomach. Not shying away of someone who can be easily regarded as ‘’fit’’. \n\nHer chest is decently sized, for elves standards. Below her breasts lies the expanse of her stomach, relatively slender and quite feminine if one were to ignore the slightly toned muscles of her abdomen. A slim round bellybutton decorates her fit belly, unmistakably feminine in appearance. Below, her firm waist flares into wide hips that share the same width as her chest. Giving her a near perfect hour-glass shape to her body. Though many wouldn't say they had born any children in the past. They support a firm backside, large in size and not shy of a copious amount of flesh. Both her hands and feet fit the rest of her body, with slender, dainty fingers that show a certain roughness from wielding weapons throughout the years.\n\nAru’naere can usually be seen wearing just one outfit, befitting her profession. Her Dark Ranger uniform, which has been altered to fit her fighting style, consists primarily of gambeson, a sturdy kind of jacket with a padded armor-design. It also consists of several mail elements of iron, adding to her protection. The attire was designed to not hinder her movements and mobility too much. In total, her clothing doesn’t show much skin if any. \n\nHer frame is tightly wrapped in the layers of protection but still manage to leave little to the imagination of her body’s shape, much to the dismay of some of her comrades or the living. In terms of scent, Aru’naere carries little to none. What can be perceived is a slight aroma of blood and forests, but only those with an exceptional sense of smell would be able to discern this..{/col}\n\n{icon:Garrison_Building_Armory:25}{col:88ff3e} - Weapons{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Side arm:\nAttached to her belt, Aru’naere carries a simple dagger. It’s usually stored away in a sheath of black leather which shows some sign of wear. The corners of her sheath are starting to let loose, but they do not break just yet. The dagger itself is of elven origin, a slight curve in its blade moves upward to a pointy tip. Its one-side sharp edge can be utilized for combat, as well as carving, cutting and other more civilian purposes. \n\nThe grip is bound in a grey leather bandage which has slight discoloration of brown spots, likely dried blood. At the pommel dangles a small string which carries an oval shaped broche with her personal crest upon it; a single crimson wing with a silver background. Though its colors have long faded for the most part.\n\nBow:\nAru’naere is relatively simplistic when it comes to her arsenal of weapons. Though most of her prowess comes from the dark arts of shadowmancy, she, as most of her kind, is still very skillful with her bow. The sturdy looking weapon seems to have seen many winters in the past and eyes like a family heirloom. Its long bark-like features are plated with protective elements of iron, which in turn is colored in a nearly cyber-grape hue with silver filigreed veins covering the edges. \n\nAt the very center of both flanks of the bow are sharp blades attached, which serve as a close-combat measure should the situation demand it. Though they add some weight to the bow, it doesn’t unbalance the weapon in the slightest, further complimenting the ancient craftsmanship of high elven society. On her back, she carries an equally cyber-grape quiver with the same silver decorations as the bow, showing that the two were crafted at the same time and from the exact same materials. It’s padded with a thin layer of layer to protect the wood some more. \n\nThe strap carries around her shoulders, allowing her easy access for the sharp and diverse assortment of arrows that it holds. At least eighty of these projectiles are usually stored in the quiver. Most have their standard design with Hawkstrider feathers at the rear, though some have unusual shapes, varying from blunt but heavy points, to arrows with several tips, all of which serve a certain purpose in combat. Though she barely speaks its name, Aru’naere refers to her bow as ‘’Quel’thas’’; high forest in the elven tongue.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{icon:Creatureportrait_AltarofFlame:25}{col:88ff3e} - Service record{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Wrath of the Lich King:{/col} {col:ffffff}Wrathgate, Icecrown Siege{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Cataclysm:{/col} {col:ffffff}War for Gilneas{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Mists of Pandaria:{/col} {col:ffffff}Scouting missions{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Warlords of Draenor:{/col} {col:ffffff}Guarding Undercity{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Legion:{/col} {col:ffffff}Broken Shore (both invasions){/col}\n{col:ffffff}Battle for Azeroth:{/col} {col:ffffff}The Gathering, War of the Thorns{/col}\n\n{icon:inv_misc_matchbook:25}{col:88ff3e} - In Character bits{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Voice reference: Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing (English) {/col} {link*https://youtu.be/yE7FCD_KIh4?t=15s*Link}\n\n{icon:Achievement_LegionPVP4Tier2:25}{col:88ff3e} - Out Of Character bits{/col}\n{col:ffffff}± 13 Years of RP experience.\nCharacter existence: 10 years (20/08/2010)\nAlways approachable.\nRPing this Dark Ranger's Character ever since Wrath.\nCan do /roll RP, but I prefer emotes.\nKind, knowledgeable about lore, friendly, helpful, giving new people a chance, respectful, tolerating, direct.\nBody dimensions were taking from the real life model Barbara Palvin with a slight increase in numbers to match the height better.{/col}\n\n{icon:INV_Inscription_Warpaint_Red:25}{col:88ff3e} - Artwork{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Paid commissions:{/col}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/Yq6Ds20*Falaa - Non-hodded version}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/ZWtPlJM*Falaa - Hooded version}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/cCRmR2P*AntheiaVaulor (Most accurate depiction)}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/FsSDnFG*AntheiaVaulor 2}\n{link*https://imgur.com/thlLudA*SurrealKati}\n\n{col:ffffff}Self-made work:{/col}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/rttC4Af*April 2020}\n{link*https://imgur.com/UA7AwJj*Profile}\n{link*https://imgur.com/CoNYYiT*Relaxing}\n{link*https://imgur.com/3JJq5Sj*Scamp!}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/WOYZMad.png*Ranger on the Hunt}\n\n{icon:icon_upgradestone_mechanical_epic:25}{col:88ff3e} - Useful RP Addons.{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Listener - Addon that lets you make a sepperate window with people you are chatting to. useful for crowded places.\n\nMusician - Music addon to listen and make your own music and listen to others who have the same addon.\n\nElephant - Addon to store up to 10k lines of text.

Born on the Darkspear Isles and along with the entire tribe he travelled and lived alongside with other trolls for the most of his early life. His parents were dedicated headhunters that served the tribe well. His father Buji was a hunter, knowing his way around the bow, javelins and animals he taught Vuji all he knew and so young troll followed steps of his father meanwhile his mother Tinji even though she served the tribe as a headhunter, she was always curious about the voodoo and witch doctors. This kind of curiosity she managed to pass onto Vuji.\n\nOnce the tribe moved to Echo Isles, there young troll finally started taking first steps into the real world, learning all kinds of responsibilities as well as training hard to become a good headhunter. Vuji never had any problems handling raptors, neither the bow or any kind of ranged weapon. Concerning animals, Vuji loved them, spending lots of time in the dens getting taught by the beastmaster. Thanks to him he befriended one of the youngest and the weakest raptors from the entire den. Taking care of little snapper, Vuji gave it a name \"Ko'tulak\" and made sure that his new friend will grow strong to stand equal to all the other raptors that served as companions and mounts to the Darkspear Tribe.\n\nSpending most of his time around Sen'jin, Vuji's daily chores were based on hunting animals of Durotar, collecting herbs and stones that he found on his little adventures around the village. Living a happy and careless life he befriended almost everyone in Sen'jin, and whenever someone needed help, Vuji was always there to lend a hand.\n\nYears passed, as Vuji and Ko'tulak were growing up together till the point where Vuji's parents decided for him, that it is time to leave warm and safe surroundings of Echo Isles and serve the horde as best as he could. Vuji didn't mind - he always liked to travel and see things, meet new people, learn new cultures and languages. Curious of the world, he finished whatever tasks he had left then along with his loyal companion, they travelled.{/col}\n\n{h3:c}History{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}   Vuji is a troll from the Darkspear tribe. Born on the Darkspear Isles and along with the entire tribe he travelled and lived alongside with other trolls for the most of his early life. His parents were dedicated headhunters that served the tribe well. His father Buji was a hunter, knowing his way around the bow, javelins and animals he taught Vuji all he knew and so young troll followed steps of his father meanwhile his mother Tinji even though she served the tribe as a headhunter, she was always curious about the voodoo and witch doctors. This kind of curiosity she managed to pass onto Vuji.\n\nVuji's history started when he joined his first guild and met all different races of the horde. Aiding them in their chores and tasks, young troll tried to learn how things are handled by the other people. He observed, asked questions and kept on learning till the point when together with that guild they joined a war campaign against the Alliance which took place in Outland, Hellfire Peninsula. This campaign was the first ever experience of what war looks like, leaving Vuji both intrigued and disturbed at the same time. Nevertheless, he had to serve the horde as his parents told him, and he was representing his beloved tribe - with that though he has slain many alliance soldiers together with his comrades.\n\nTime was flying as Vuji was learning about the world. Finally feeling decent with his combat skills he participated in many tournaments hosted by other guilds and represented the organisation he belonged to. Such course of things lasted till the Horde launched an expedition to Pandaria and that's where Vuji's life turned into a completely different direction. Meeting first Pandaren and monks, he felt that this way of things was his destiny so after several assaults on the shores of Pandaria, he decided to go on a pilgrimage. Travelling with his loyal friend Ko'tulak, he reached monastery where he was warmly welcomed - as if it was his home. One of Pandaren teachers named Ching Shao Hao Chin Chun became his master and Vuji began training in the ways of the monk.\n\nAt this point, Vuji lost a sense of time, dedicated to his training and to the new community that surrounded him, he didn't feel that he is actually getting lost in time. Losing sense of the day and night, years and seasons, his previous memory got partly erased leaving him only pieces of what he knew before with current memory of being a monk. It took a very long time for Vuji to realise that something is not right and since then he excuses his mind absence as \"time travelling\". This term serves him as an explanation to moments when losing the sense of time and place hits him. So far, he has never found out what was the cause and the beginning of such a problem.\n\nEventually, after Garrosh's open aggression and corruption by the Sha, Vuji returned to Kalimdor, joined Darkspear rebellion and fought together with his fellow brothers and sisters once again and since then, he travelled the world as a monk and a headhunter of the Darkspear Tribe.{/col}\n\n{h3:c}Appearance{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}Beginning with the whole build of his body, Vuji is a little bit taller than average jungle trolls. His posture is hunched just like most races of the horde, his skin has a shade of green and concerning his weight Vuji is quite slim. However, even though being slim, it is visible on his revealed body parts that Vuji did not waste time during his time in Pandaria. Strong and well build body, agile and shaped into a perfect state. Vuji's hair is green and bushy, sometimes standing on his head and sometimes falling behind his long trollish ears. His eyes are green just like the rest of his body, his nose pointy and his tusks are medium-sized pointing forward.\n\nAn observant eye can notice after watching Vuji walk or move, that he is agile and his reflex can only be matched by the other monks or rogues. Every time when Vuji takes a step it looks like he is testing the ground as if it was about to fall, or perhaps that's how most of the trolls move.{/col}\n\n{h3:c}Character{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}Vuji is an extrovert troll. Open to anybody, social, happy and cheerful. He is very helpful and finds joy in simple things. Things that he dislikes can be counted on fingers of one hand whereas a list of things or activities he likes, seems to be endless. It is very hard to anger Vuji, whenever possible he will attempt to avoid combat or conflict and instead of resorting into getting physical, he will try to talk it out. One of the problems (or traits) that Vuji got is his speech. Having quite a problem of pronouncing most of the people names, he often makes up nicknames which are easier for him to pronounce and stay positive about it. Every flaw or a mistake Vuji always will try to turn all the way around from a negative perspective into a positive one.{/col}\n\n{h3:c}Fun corner{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}In this sections I'll be posting links related to Vuji.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:r}{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Ee4TevHfA*What's going on inside of his head}{/p}\n{p:r}{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vkR1G_DUVc*Timewalking Song}{/p}\n{p:r}{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363662933424603136/549707165376708617/test_fery.png*Vuji and Aurithil}{/p}",

A soul cursed to a form of beastdom that he's adopted into his typical appearance... but a further glance merits some appealing, unique traits about him.\n\nHis countenance is the fixture of his character. A lissome, black-lipped, fang-jutting fox's face complimented by a pair of eyes that jump out from the rest of his vulpine features, though oft hidden as they are. His fur, a tyrant's choice of crimson, contrasts his particularly creamy fur palette that covers his face and parts of his body, giving him a particularly sharp demeanour.\n\nWhat does contrast the beginning notions of a blood-furred man, however, is his body. Rizail is crafted with the body of an athlete; his broad shoulders drop down into athletic arms whilst his chest compounds a wide, hunter's stature. His legs glorify themselves as much as gold contrasts copper; thick, supportive and powerful, and often buckled down in leather, his thighs are certainly what gives such a diminuitive creature such speed and strength.{/col}",

He had such a triumphant dominion over warfare, that he can be considered a tyrant. Any conflict you can think of, he fought in it. From the first assault on Stormwind, to the travesty of the Wrathgate. Urmakh Gekgrish will be remembered for his unmatched strength and unyielding dedication to his three tenets; Loyalty, Discipline and Respect. His children should not be intimidated by the forever-looming shadow of their father, never feel overwhelmed at the example he has set. But instead, should be emboldened by the blood of a champion coursing through their veins and proud of the his legacy. He was a hero in life, he deserved a hero's death. He will not be forgotten.{/col}{/p}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n{h1:c}An Unscarred Barbarian;\n{icon:Warlock_PVP_BaneHavoc:25}\n\"The Arrowcatcher\"{/h1}\n\n{col:ffffff}Urmakh Goedendag is a brutish amazon. Her limbs are like logs, her torso is like a barrel. Yet she also has a manxome attractiveness; highly toned muscles, a buxom chest, facial features that connote stoicism and attentiveness. Unlike her siblings, she has her mother's eyes; a deep orange. Yet she has her father's hair; thick, jet-black, wiry and while she tries her best, it is wild and untameable. Her skin is green with a faint touch of grey and is surprisingly scarless. Of course, she has some scars; they are unavoidable, but considering her age and her lifestyle, you would assume she would have many more.{/col}\n{h1:c}{icon:Ability_Warrior_StrengthOfArms:25}{/h1}\n{col:ffffff}The armour that Urmakh Goedendag wears is minimalistic. Her full thighs, most of her biceps, some of her abdominals and all of her back is unarmoured. Whereas the rest of her is protected with tough, sturdy plate. She is not satisfied with this; she would rather wear no plate. But, she has been prejudiced and questioned for long enough, and she now wears minimalistic armour. She is skilled enough not to get hit, or at least react in such a way that would put her out of serious harm. This skill earned her an ekename; \"The Arrowcatcher.\" She personally has no taste for it; arrow catching isn't as hard as it is made out to be. Nonetheless, she accepts it.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n{h1:c}Mighty Artifacts{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-ArtifactTEMP:256:128}\n{h3:c}{col:ffffff}There are two items of Urmakh Goedendag's possession which are truly intriguing.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{col:ffffff}Firstly, \"Dishonour's End.\" This club, in the possession of Urmakh Goedendag and long before, has seen much battle. According to the Artifacts of Azeroth Compendium Vol. 4, Dishonour's End was once the club of a fearsome but honourable Wildhammer berserker. He used it to kill many criminals and thugs. However, he was stabbed in both shoulder blades by a Dark Iron assassin, and he died shortly after... but not after caving in the assassin's skull. This act and his death imbued the club with a powerful magic, so that no one would ever sneak up on and attack the wielder of the club. Should anyone do so, the weapon would act by itself, and viciously strike at them without harming the wielder. That strike can be so powerful, it would feel like being struck by lightning. Even after that strike, the magic lingers; enhancing every strike afterwards to be much stronger!{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{icon:INV_Mace_2H_Cataclysm_B_01:25}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}As for how Urmakh Goedendag came to have this weapon, she is very vague when explaining how she found it.{/col}{/p}\n\n{col:ffffff}The second is her boots, \"Earthsunderer's Stride.\" Not only are they an artifact- magical- but they look very unique. Where her toes are, the armour is the paws of a Garn. While they have been unglorified since the coming of the New Draenor, these \"Garnclaw\" boots would be quite a spectacle to any old enough to remember the hounds, or even a historian, for remains of the Garn are hard to come by. Despite their age, the paws’ claws are still very sharp and could easily rend flesh with the right kind of kick... but any kick from these would be devastating.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{icon:Ability_HeroicLeap:25}{/h2}\n{col:ffffff}The \"Earthsunderer's Stride\" were worn by a Dark Shaman during the shattering of Draenor. The twisted power from the shaman, combined with the chaotic magics of the shattering and dying elementals all around had managed to seep into the boots and give them an echo of its destruction. Now, every step taken with the Earthsunderers creates a slight rumble. When they stamp, the earth underfoot is demolished.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{icon:Sha_Spell_Fire_BlueHellfire_nightmare:25}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Urmakh Goedendag found these boots in the Outlands, in Blade's Edge Mountain. She, some adventurers and a band of Mag'har were exploring and they came across some aggressive Ethereals that were smuggling looted relics. Among those were the Earthsunderer's Stride.{/col}{/p}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n{h1:c}Born Behind Bars{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-STORMWINDSTOCKADES:256:256}\n{col:ffffff}Urmakh Goedendag never knew her mother. Until her later years, she never knew her father either. What she did know is that she was born inside an internment camp. The Humans were harsh and abusive. Even though she was only a child, they treated her ill. This hardened her, and fueled her hatred to the Humans and the Alliance.\nWithin the confines of the camp, there was a wise, old shaman chained to a wall. He was only fed twice a week, the only water he was allowed to drink was rain. Goedendag would often approach the old wolf to hear stories of Orc's and the Horde's past. She was also told that her mother was from the Black Tooth Grin clan.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}The Dark Horde\nThe True Horde{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-BLACKWINGLAIR:256:256}\n{col:ffffff}Rend and Maim, son of Warchief Blackhand, and many other Orcish survivors warred against Alliance garrisons and internment camps. When Goedendag was almost at the age of maturing, they assaulted the camp which held her. For the first time in her life, she knew what it was like outside; she breathed fresh air, felt grass under her feet, saw trees and hills and cliffs and animals. She was fascinated by animals.\nLike the rest of those who were saved, she followed her saviors to their stronghold in Blackrock Mountain. That's where she joined the Dark Horde. She was taught more about her mother's clan, and was embraced with open arms among them. She completed the Black Tooth Grin's Om'riggor; breaking out one of her teeth to prove her loyalty to the Warcheif. When Maim fell in battle, she mourned his loss with gritted teeth and fury. She was taught how to fight, how to kill. She was taught how to be a warrior. The pent-up rage that stirred in her heart could finally be released; she drew strength from her anger and unleashed her wrath on the soldiers and villagers in Redridge mountain.\n\nHowever, that would all change when the \"False Horde\" attacked. The Dark Horde saw The Horde as a charade. They disagreed to Thrall's leadership, and disregarded Grommash's sacrifice. The two Hordes were in conflict. Eventually, their conflict resolved with the ransacking of Blackrock Mountain, and the Dark Horde was crushed.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}A New Horde...{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-OrgrimmarDownfall:256:256}\n\n{col:ffffff}Almost all members of the Dark Horde were killed in the battle. Many who survived were executed. Many of those who weren't were put in the service of the Kor'kron. Very few came out of the conflict \"free.\" Goedendag was one of those few. While technically part of the Horde, she has no true binding to the faction. At the first chance she got, she left the fortress city of Orgrimmar and ventured on her own. She traveled all across Azeroth, seeing many sights and having great adventures, with as little contact to the Horde as she could have. Her lifestyle as a barbarian was free, but taxing; she often spent days without food or clean water.\n\nAfter a while, she decided to use her strengths to feed herself. Goedendag worked as a mercenary- though she never called herself one. She took work from many Horde or natural settlements across the land- sometimes, she was tasked to work with or for Humans, or other races that she had grown a strong hatred for. However, she learnt discipline from the Dark Horde, and tolerance from the Horde. She bit her lip and did what she was tasked.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}A Father's Love{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-BLACKROCKSPIRE:256:256}\n{col:ffffff}Urmakh Gekgrish found Goedendag years later in Northrend. She was there in the later days of the war against the Lich King. Urmakh Gekgrish was stationed there- in a stronghold that just so happened to be where Goedendag was. The behemoth saw the barbarian and instantly knew his own blood. She, on the other hand, did not and was- for perhaps the first time in her life- truly intimidated, and she didn't know why.\n\nEvents transpired, after many hours of shouting, denial, items being thrown and fists being swung, Goedendag acknowledged Gekgrish as her father. She was given the name \"Urmakh\" and taught her family's traditions. She was told more about her mother; she was a strong, proud Orc with a will of iron and conviction of steel. She was Urmakh Gekgrish's last mate, making Urmakh Goedendag the youngest of the Urmakh.\n\nAfter she was left with a new name and identity, Urmakh Goedendag did not know what to do. She now had a father, something she had never thought would happen. But, like all meaningful events in her life, she grunted it away and continued her adventure. This time, she was more closely tied to the Horde, as she knew she had a family that was part of it. She remains neutral- yet against the Alliance- and embarked on many more quests, with the new-found vigor from the revelations from her father- even if he was an abusive brute who cared only for warfare.\n\nShe fights on to this day, now closer to the Horde yet still considers herself neutral. She has become stronger, bolder and more determined to prove herself to any and all, and most importantly; to survive.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n{h1:c}The Last Gift\nThe Only Gift\nThe Greatest Gift{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-VrykulDrinkingHorn:512:256}\n{col:ffffff}Urmakh Gekgrish was known to many as not only a champion, but an uncaring brute. However, there was one thing he cared for with a passion.\n\nDuring the wars in Stonetalon Mountains, Urmakh Gekgrish came across a dying wyvern whelp. His first thought was to ignore it- but as he heard the creature's infantile yowling of distress, the thug's heart melted.\n\nShouk, he named it. He tended to his wounds, nurtured him back to health, trained him to run, fly, even speak. After years, Shouk grew into a mighty wyvern, with rippling muscles, a dire, barbed tail, and a roar that deafens the weak. His voice is baritone and gravely, similar to his adopted father's, but more beastial.{/col}\n{h1:c}{icon:INV_Misc_EliteWyvern:25}{/h1}\n{col:ffffff}Urmakh Gekgrish died. He left very little for his sons and daughters, but what he did give was meaningful. Urmakh Goedendag was given the gift to look over her father's adopted son, Shouk. She carries a small horn with her always that will summon him to her. Despite their difference in species, they treat each other as brother and sister, and are the only children of Urmakh Gekgrish that get along with each other.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n",

This fur covered the upper portions of face, obscuring his features often, though was occasionally brushed or held aside to reveal underneath. The taurens face was typically painted with a variety of runes and symbols, centred around his eyes and trailing down to his snout and neck. Upon either side of his head sat his horns, average in size, though heavily adorned. Their lengths had been carefully carved away with similar patterns the Shu'halo coated himself in, before being repaired and filled with gold.\n\nThe taurens torso bore the continuation of the runic patterns he so readily adorned, in a light blue paint, continuing along his arms and presumably, along his lower body as well.

Though not orphaned, her parents were often absent in her life after her birth as they, also casteless, scraped a living outside the city by any meager means necessary. \n\nOften left in the care of other vagrants, Yin'tawa soon learnt the joys of spending her time around water, going swimming with other children and fishing in small boats they crafted. For the majority of her childhood this was a peaceful existance with little to no interference.\n\nEventually Yin'tawa's affinity for the water became noted by an Acolyte of Gral whom had often spent time at the docks blessing the ships which travelled to the port. Approaching the youngster, he spoke of the great shark Loa and asked that she might consider her future in the service of him. Deciding to undertake such a role, the young Yin'tawa soon joined the other followers at Atal'Gral to devote her service to the Loa. She developed her abilities and became a keen navigator and often joined her mentor in blessing the ships which left Zandalari.\n\nOnce a young adult, Yin'tawa alongside some others of her Loa's following were driven from their beloved temple by the Naga. Returning to the great city from where she was born, the next five years were spent with the young woman scraping together an existance via vagrancy and suffering constantly at the hands of brutality from the hired hands that roamed the docks.\n\nAfter a time spent under the guidance of a self-proclaimed Prophet and a group of Zulians, Yin'tawa found herself led along by their beliefs for several months until eventually finding that her Loa's needs were of more importance. Further months spent in Nazjatar fighting against the Naga threat led the woman away from the group she had affiliated herself with and back into a more neutral position.{/col}{/p}\n",

He was raised and later began his new life in undeath as a Forsaken, vowing vengeance upone the Scourge and the Lich King and to follow the beloved Banshee Queen, Sylvanas.\n\nFollowing the death of the Lich King, Fethagor started to aid his people and the Horde in the only ways he knew how. By sword and hammer, fighting and forging weapons and armour. Although, for a time he began to feel lost and soon felt void of purpose or meaning... Until he was introduced to the Ravensun and the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow.\n\nWith his spirit rekindled and his devotion to the Banshee Queen ever stronger, Fethagor fought on and to this day remains a devoted inquisitor of the Ravensun.\n\n\n{p:c}After the Fourth War{/p}\nWith the Undercity and Sylvanas gone, Fethagor is faced with a new reality like most of his kinsmen.

Usually kept long and wild it reaches the bottom of his back, decorated as well with pair of ram like horns.\n\n{h2}{col:00ff00}Gear / Weapons{/col}{/h2}\nThis demon hunters customary attire consist of the \"Ilidari\" battle armor, a combination of metal engraved demonic details, leather and fur, styled in elven fashion.\nThe weapon choice are mostly his striking warglavies, yet at times he uses twin blades enhcanted with demonic runes. \nThere is also a hunting knife designed in Ilidari style, well  hidden at the side of his boot, and occasionally there can be noticed a coiled whip hanging from the  left side of his waist, the weapon remnant left from his entity.\n\n{h2}{col:38ff51}Art{/col}{/h2}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/fx0DnmS*Dana art by @freakyxwannaxbe}\n{link*https://imgur.com/h6Iftzm* Dana doodle by me}\n{link*http://lore.heroesofnewerth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Incubus_Succubus_Wallpaper.jpg*Demonic form reference}\n\n\n{h2}{col:00ff00}Achievements, medals {/col}{/h2}\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/555824927119245342/699662807742021774/horde-silver.png*Twiligh Hills expedition}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/674960451767107614/691700602559791145/medalNowords.png*End of Days - Assault on Pandaria campaign}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/636013256435302408/721843580431368222/TwilightEnd-VoidPortal-Emblem-2.png*Twilight Star campaign}\n\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/232878*The Fel Hunt AA}\n\n\n\n",

Her short brown hair is swept back into two separate pony-tails; supported by red bands. The strands too short to be held back fall down either side of her face, just reaching the top of her cheekbones. Her wide eyes glimmer a faint emerald green, holding a captivating sight. She displays a youthful and pale rose complexion, sharing similar facial features with her twin sister.\n\nHer skin seems flawless, aside from her left wrist which sports a tattoo displaying the initials 'O.S.T'. Her flesh bares no scars nor injuries. Covering most of her body is a red attire; her cropped shirt exposing her abdomen. She's often attired in light, thin cloths. Whichever attire she's wearing is always accompanied by a golden emblem, symbolising her relationship with the House she was born into.{/col}\n\n\n{h2}{col:1100ff}Characteristics{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-93:64:64}\n{col:00ff69}What seems to be a well-composed individual is merely a false exterior masking both anxiety and shyness. Lia is considered pleasant company to keep around due to her constant kindness and respect shown towards others; but also due to her quietness. She suffers from a form of memory loss, so a lot of experiences are forgotten.{/col}\n\n\n{h2}{col:1100ff}History{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\FlavorImages\\BloodElfLogo-small:256:256}\n{col:00ff69}After birth, Lia was not fortunate to meet her parents. Instead, she and her twin sister were raised by their elder brother, Solaen, and his partner, Shaana. The young, mischievous pair were brought up in Eversong, causing chaos wherever they could. The two spent their younger years stealing whatever they could. During their time being raised by Solaen, Lia was introduced to some of her brother's closest friends who began training her at a young age; teaching her the basics of how to use smaller blades like daggers.\n\nAfter the passing of a mentor and her brother, Lia took some time way from Silvermoon; keeping with two other Elves. One of the elves offered to teach Lia pyromancy during their time away, teaching her to control and master the ability.Time passed and Lia eventually returned to Silvermoon, reuniting with both her sister and Shaana.{/col}",

Bright an' smilin' usually, holdin' pride in his people as he carries de golden insignia of zandalar on his back, gold embeded into his skin.  A tense and sturdy figure, he's not the tallest or strongest of his kind, but he ain't neva' gonna let dat stop him.  A friendler disposition den most, dere usually be a bright smile between his two curling, golden tusks that are fitted over de stubs o' recently broken ones, don't ask 'im. Wit' de war finally ova', dis one be wanderin' fo' his own enjoyment, lookin' t' you, he prolly gonna get ya in trouble!  {/col}\n\n{h1}De tings we have done neva stop haunting us{/h1}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-mop-IsleoftheThunderKing:512:256}\n{col:711613}     How anger drives us t' terrible things.\n\n    When da island of zandalar was shattered as zul foretold, thousands were killed, and rastakhan did nothing.  Nazwatha was sinking into da sea, becoming nothing but a desolate swamp.  Da people begged for an answer from de king, de loa, anyone, and dere was only zul.  I was young when he came, a lil lost soul, an' he used me t' coax and provoke da people to action, \"rescuing\" me and all de other homeless zandalari into a campaign to reunite our tribes.  Anger drove us to follow, drove us to zul'aman, zul' gurub, and all da way to pandaria.  I was grown by den, a proud warscout, one of da most zealous too.I believed in da zandalari, I believed in zul.  We never believed dat he would abandon us completely at de isle of thunder, all of us left lost an' alone after de champions killed de thunder king.  We saw de destruction we created, and I knew dere was only shame.  All de tribes were scattered, some even enslaved by de raging mogu, dey were relentless, furious. Most dat survived wandered their own way, stranded dere.  Lightnin' coiled and crackled at me tribe first, I watched many a nazmani dissapear foreva...bein' a warscout taught me well when t' retreat t' fight anotha day.  It still felt wrong.  Didn't work dat well though, when dose stony fingers strangled me, I rememba de days I spent there, makin' us toil as payment for failure, as if it wasn't dere king dat died too.  Was a long time before any o' us could escape, but de biggest weakness of de mogu was dere constant infightin'.  As anotha clan came t' \"claim payment for failure\", we swam, swam for all o' our lives back to de mainland.  De taste of saltwater is somethin' I neva want in ma mouth again.  But we did it, we were free. {/col}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Most notably, however, the pommel of the sword seems to be of the same material and shaped like the head of a cloud serpent.

He has long, flowing Platinum-blonde hair, kept clean and shiny by washing and combing often. His skin is slightly more pale than most Sin'dorei, his nose is straight and delicate, his ears long and pointed like so many Sin'dorei, his chin prominent, bright verdant green eyes, long yet trimmed eyebrows and various burns and cuts scarring his left shoulder as well as horizontally across his right year where some of it was cut off and quickly cauterised back on.{/col}\n\n\n{h3}Saelen's Personality:{/h3}\n\n{col:3cff30}Saelen is many things to many people depending on your point of view. However at his heart is he inquisitive, adventurous, in possession of a thirst for knowledge, confident, passionate, humorous, and conscientionous. Whilst also being a little impulsive, conceited, Surly, pompous, sarcastic and malicious at the best of times.\n\nSaelen tries to keep things simple in life when interacting with others, those who show respect and kindness often recieve the same back from him, those who display ignorant, rude or judgemental behaviour right out of the gate will often me met with sarcastic or malicious comments until they redeem themselves in his eyes..{/col}\n\n\n{h3}Saelen's History:{/h3}\n\n{col:3cff30}Born in Silvermoon to Delana and Dal'neth Dawnflare, Saelen quickly showed a talent of magic beyond that of the natural affinty all Sin'dorei have. Was born and raised in Silvermoon and studied to become an Arcanist. Saelen lost his parents to the conflict of the Second War. Was born naturally frail physically. After the loss of the Sunwell Saelen was introduced to his crippling weaknesses, while having an affinity for magic his aura and his magic itself seemed unstable and he would often lose energy faster than others, this on top of his newly discoverd magical addiction from living in a such a heavy, magic-infused land and his frailness left him crippled, almost becoming like one of those who would later be called the wretched over night..Saelen made a choice that night that shaped who he is today.\n\nSince accepting the Fel and turning down what many perceive to be a darker path Saelen has only excelled and left the comforts of Quel'Thalas behind to travel Azeroth and even beyond, taking on different titles and duties as he travelled such as Bounty Hunter, Radical, Warlock, Adventurer, Captain, Courier, Associate and Librarian. All the while conducting his own research into various forms of magic and working towards other goals.\n\nThe Saelen of today has long shrugged off the chains of his past, striving to further knowledge in many fields of magic as a \"Savant\" as he calls himself refusing to fully accept the narrow-minded label of warlock that many others would saddle him with. Saelen has also spent years tackling his weaknesses head on fighting through his addiction and strengthening his body he now possesses a more toned figure than before and lives a more disciplined life for the sake of his own survival and aims to achieve high and lofty goals.{/col}",

Limbs still far too long for him and movements forever clumsy and heavy handed. The laid back scoundrel has a certain air of innocence about him under the wit and bravado. Mirth filled grins and a trademark scoundrel smirk have been perfected and flashed without warning, though he's never uninviting, efforts always made. A thief through and through, but a worldly one at that, invested with enough colour to lighten up any greyscale. A thick crimson beard clings to a constantly smiling jaw, never groomed or clean. \n\nIn his eyes swims a fair amount of story; and more weight than one so young should carry on his shoulders - his right ear has been sliced at the top, the pointed tip of it entirely removed and now resembling a crescent, perhaps a gift bestowed on him for his trade. When the eyepatch is not worn, his right eye appears unmoving and unblinking, lacking a fel glow and shines as if glass. One of the many stories written upon his face is that of the thin sliver of silver that bisects his upper lip, the tale of which is up for much debate and embellishment, but even the most experienced at escaping authorities can fall victim to bottles and bar fights.{/col}\n\nLoud and often obnoxious, with his own charm and confidence; Tal is not to everyone's tastes. He often lacks tact which he tries to offset with wit, but never lacks kindess or a sensitive heart, even with his own brand of cockiness - the smile he throws around is genuine and one for all, as harmless as anything that hails from Booty Bay.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-102:64:64}\n\n",

No, I am not an orcling! I am a GOBLIN, ya know small, green, likes gold...I forget how old I am exactly, it's not something I really bothered to keep track of! Hard to describe myself really...as I change my hair colour and style often to suit my outfit! But ya know, I’m not much different from other Goblins really, I am just way more stylish! \n\nOh yea, I like taking selfies with my camera thing, mostly with my companions...so if ya want to be in a photo just ask! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_misc_book_10:40}History{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Hey…HEY! Down here *waves*. Yea now I have your attention, the name is Slacker…just Slacker…I ain’t important enough to have two names or a title. So ya probably heard of me, right? Whatcha mean no? Well lets see…most call me the worst thief in Azeroth. Why? Well…because sometimes I get caught stealing things. Like this one time I was trying to steal this jewel that I was told was hidden in the Undercity, I bought this map off a drunk Orc. I should have been suspicious as the map was drawn on what looked like a piece of toilet paper…and I think I was reading the map upside down, so I ended up in right in front of Sylvanas, whoops! I really should learn how to read maps better. \n\nLet’s see what else, oh yea cause I’m a Goblin I mostly go unnoticed when I’m not thieving that is, which means I hear things ya know? Like did you know there is no such thing as a female dwarf, honest it’s true! And I also heard that Pandarens don’t like chocolate cause it disagrees with them, at least that’s what my friend’s sister’s cousin’s gardener says.\n\nI dunno what else to put in this thing…oh yea I have a pet dog called Bandit, he follows me everywhere! Including when I go thieving…which is probably why I get caught because he likes to bark at the most inappropriate times.\n\nOh yea, and I may not look it but I can fight! Honest I can, I killed many of the Legion’s demons, yea I’m pretty awesome when it comes to things like that\n\nWell I think that’s it, if you see me say “Hi” or something, I’m nice…really I am{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:petbattle_health:40}Lil’ Buddies{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}I have three companions, a white frost wolf pup named Bandit. He found me when I was adventuring in Dreanor, he has been by my side ever since...and no I didn’t steal him if that is what you are thinking! Bandit is my bestest friend in the whole world, probably because he is one of my only friends really...\n\nThe other companion is a Robot named Blaster...he is from SPACE! At least that’s what he tells me...I found him in pieces at the bottom of this HUGE creator, I fixed him up as best as I could and his first words to me were \"beep boop beep\" which I think means \"we are friends forever\" either that or \"I have come to destroy your planet\"\n\nAnd finally, there is Kay Nine, a Robot dog a built all by myself…he may have gone through a few redesigns and reconstructions though! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:spell_tailor_mountspeedup01:40}Noble Steeds{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Yea I have a couple of other animal friends that help me get around Azeroth, they are an pair but hey they seem to like me for some reason or another.\n\nEd, oh Ed…the lovable goofball! Long story short, basically I was in Vol’dun…the big, dry desert! This Hyena kept following me and laughing at me, I have no idea why exactly but whatever. Anyways, I got ambushed by a bunch of blood thirsty Hyenas. I thought I was doomed, so I didn’t know what to do…I was gonna try and fight my way out, until Ed came outta nowhere and fought them all off! So, we became good friends, and I spent hours trying to name him, went through every name I could think of and he didn’t like any of them! When I jokingly said the name “Ed” he laughed lots, which I think meant he liked that name. \n\nFinally, we have Squish. It is probably my favourite, because it can fly…but don’t tell Ed that! So once again I was exploring…getting lost, like I do, and I decided to eat some lunch. I had just “acquired” a nice piece of steak that I was gonna cook up and this thing jumped at me! I thought it was gonna kill me! Turns out, it was hungry and wanted my steak, so I gave it my steak and it decided to hang around with me. Some say Squish is evil and stuff, but honestly Squish is very friendly and nice! And I call Squish “it” because honestly…you tell me! Is it a boy thing or a girl thing! I don’t even know how ya tell! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:ui_horde_honorboundmedal:40}The Horde{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What do I think of the Horde? It’s alright, I ‘spose. Seems like some members don’t like us Goblins, they look down on us and I don’t mean ‘cause we are short and small…We aren’t all money grabbing buttfaces, ok well some of us are…but then some of us are super awesome and cool! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:achievement_leader_sylvanas:40}Sylvanas{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Oh, you wanna know what I think about Sylvanas, well she don’t like me much and I guess I don’t like her either? I mean don’t get me wrong, she has done some great things for the Horde, made us stronger…but I dunno, as of late she is becoming like…that guy. You know the guy *breathes in and impersonates the Lich King perfectly* THE EVIL DUDE WHO SAT ON THE CHAIR OF ICE AND LIKED UNDEAD AND HATED CAKES *coughs* ugh, impersonating him hurts my throat! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_axe_2h_saurfang_c_01:40}Saurfang{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}So, you wanna know what I think about the other guy, Saruman? That’s his name, right? Oh, oooh! Saurfang is the guy people are talking about? He is one cool dude! I heard something about him getting into trouble. He is ok in my books *brings out a small book* see, says right here “Saurfang is ok”. \n\nI met him once, ya I did! So, I was exploring the world, as I do, and I walked into this horde camp just wanting to get some supplies and I bumped into him. At first, I was scared because he is a big guy and he wears some hefty armour, but he knelt down and asked me my name. I was shocked, no Orc has ever knelt down to talk to me…heck Orcs don’t talk to me much at all…So I told him my name and he asked to see my sword, he took it in his hand and advised me that “It’s a good blade, strong and well made” and then he asked me do I fight for the honour of the horde or do I fight for myself…so I was honest with him “I’ll fight anyone who picks on my friends but I ain’t about fighting or killing someone for no reason” and he patted me on the head and smiled. So, Saurfang to me at least, is a-ok.  {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:spell_misc_emotionhappy:40}Hobbies & Interests{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Ya anna know what stuff I like besides “borrowing” stuff and feeding my face with Ice Cream and Sweets until I barf? Well, I like to hang with the few friends I have (which isn’t many!) and I love to play with my animal buddies, Bandit just LOVES it when I play fetch with him! Oh, and I LOVE to go exploring and on adventures! \n\nOf course I do like to mess around with inventing things using spare parts I “find” and I also like to play guitar, yea I am a superstar! I found this broken little guitar when I was on my travels, it may not sound the best but I do enjoy strumming out a tune or two…I even wrote a song! Hell yea, its gonna be like the song everyone will be singing someday! Check it out below…{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_axe_2h_undeadguitar_c_01:40}The Fresh Goblin from Kezan!{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Now this is the story all about how\nMy Goblin life got flipped turned upside down\nAnd I'd like to take a minute \nJust relax and sit your butt right down\nIll tell ya how I became the fresh Goblin from Kezan!\n\nOn an Island called Kezan, born and raised\nOn the race track is where I spent most of my days\nZippin' and Zoomin' being up to no good{/col}\n{col:FFFFFF}'til a giant dragon started shooting fireballs in my neighborhood\nScreamin' and shoutin' everyone runnin' around\nWonderin what to do there was no help to be found\n'til Gallywix yelled \"Gimmeh your gold and your lives will be saved!\"\nTo the bank I ran not knowin' I was about to be betrayed\nI was thrown on a boat and made slave!\n\"You belong to me now, so dontcha misbehave\"\n\nSet sail we did, Gallywix in-charge\n'till Alliance ships saw our lil sail barge\nFired at us and sank us they did\nTo the nearest island we swam and we hid\nMet a big green dude we did, his name was Thrall\n\"Follow me little goblins and there will be safety for all!\"\n\nJoined the Horde and went to Ogrimmar \nGallywix came too, to which we all thought bizzare!\nWe pulled up to the gates about 7 or 8\nI yelled to Thrall \"yo, thanks smell ya later\"\nI looked at the City I was finally in\nTo sit on my butt as the fresh Goblin from Kezan! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:ability_ironmaidens_ironwill:40}Other Facts and Random Stuff{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}So other stuff about me, let’s see…I have X-Ray vision! *laughs* nah not really, I’m just goofin’ with ya! Well ya know you can always say to me “Hey Slacker, what’s something I don’t know about ya?” and I’ll give you an answer for sure.\n\nOh, did I tell ya about my hero? I take it by the blank look on your face the answer is no, we all gotta have a hero ya know someone to look up to. Hey stop laughing! I aint that short that I look up at everyone, sheesh. Anyways, my hero is the mighty THRALL! Why? Cause he is frickin awesome, we Goblins helped him out long ago and he in return made us part of the Horde. I have a super rare Thrall action figure and not only that but I have a first edition near mint Thrall Hearthstone card I keep with me at ALL times! If you ask nicely you can see it, just make sure you washed those hands of yours!\n\nI always have ice cream or cakes on me, so if you want one just ask! I keep them in a magic bag *wiggles her fingers all mysteriously* well it’s not really magic, just good at keeping the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold. \n\nMy skills with engineering seem to be getting better, I like to mess around making (and breaking) things. So far none of my inventions have resulted in my death, so I gotta be doing something right! \n\nOh, last thing. I am a very friendly Goblin, honestly it is hard for me to hate anyone. Heck I even made friends with a Murloc once! I mean yea, I don’t like the Alliance but ya know that’s sorta a given thing with members of Horde I suppose. {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_garrison_cargoship:40}The Future{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What are my plans for the future? Well, once this stupid War is over, because it has to end at some point? I want continue my adventure with my animal companions by getting myself a boat. Not one of those huge fancy schmancy boats the Horde and Alliance use, but a small boat just big enough for me and my pals. Maybe…I could build one? I am good at building stuff when needed to! But anyways, yeah explore the seas maybe find myself my own Island…That’s the life for me, because there is nothing scary or dangerous out at sea, right? {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:achievement_bg_grab_cap_flagunderxseconds:40}Post War Activities{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What have I been up to since the war ended? Gee, what haven’t I been up to! Let’s see, at first, I got a job fixing up the damaged and broken mechs and over goblin inventions that got wrecked in the war. After that I had a tea party with Thrall, turns out he doesn’t like tea all that much…he sure does like a good cake though! And well, what have I been up to lately…you really wanna know? Come closer...closer…closer still…\n\nNONE OF YA GOD DAMN BUSINESS! \n\nI kid, I kid! I have spent a lot of time in Icecrown, why Icecrown ya ask? Am I looking to become the Lich Queen? No, don’t be stupid sheesh. I have been constructing Mechs, Gadgets, Gizmos and testing them there, because no one is really gonna moan if I blow up a chunk of a mountain in Icecrown. Yea, I am careful, I don’t blow stuff up near the Citadel. \n\nMy latest invention is pretty awesome if I do so say so myself, which I do…a lot! One of my Mechs had its arms fall off randomly one day, I think I didn’t tighten some of the bolts or something. Then it hit me, quick swapping of Mech parts! Can easily be done, so I developed a new system of connections and relays which allow for a Mech to have its arms quickly changed for Drills or Guns…or a Cake Gun! I call it the Lock and Load System. I have made quite a bit of money selling this system to Mech owners. See I am smart and only I know exactly how to fit it properly without it causing catastrophic failure.\n\nOh, the Boat? Yea I built it, haven’t had a chance to take it anywhere…haven’t even named it yet! I was thinking the Awesome Ship of Amazing Awesomeness! Whatcha mean that’s too long of a name! Fine I’ll think of a better name at some point…{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_misc_paperbundle04b:40}Art{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}This is where I would put my Art...If I had some! {/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-rogue-dreadblades:256:128}\n",

His hair is a mildly-tamed mane and groomed to some extent though not meticulously so. On occassion, two piercing and pale grey eyes stare forth from the sockets - though otherwise met with a blank stare of two enblackened sockets themselves.\n\nHis expression of fashion through attire tends to vary from ritualistic to political in purpose, but all seems made with high and expensive clientele in mind. Every stitch is seemless, every detail is polished and refined.\n\nWalking behind him, one would not find a shadow regardless of the sun's position or any other extravagant source of light and shadow. \n\nHis steps are slow, calculated; methodical. Every footfall serves a purpose and a reason, and no action is taken without consideration. His presence, tone and posture bleed a singular concept; that of a higher power.{/p}{/col}\n\n{link*https://wiskerville.carrd.co/*Useful Links (Wordpress, Discord, Art Gallery, etc)}\n\n{col:d0bbff}Please note: Wiskerville is an IC member of both the Wheel of Entropy (the Brotherhood) and the Aegis of Ibraesyl.{/col}",

Not muscular as his warrior-kin, but years of loneliness made his body strong and durable. He has deep-dark skin of a Blackrock orc, but he doesn't consider himself one. He wears light cloth mixed with skin, that empowers his abilities to speak to spirits.\n\n|TInterface\\Icons\\inv_shield_ironhorde_d_01:20|tIn his youth, he fell into a frenzy and killed or mutilated his family - parents and siblings. Terrified of his deed, he quickly ran away into the wilds, where he learned to survive on his own. Living so close to nature, he started to hear voices in his dreams - it was his ancestors that spoke to him. After some practice, he connected with spirits, and learned the truth about his actions - as a youngest of his family, he became a target of a jealous Darkcaster, that hated his parents. \n\n|TInterface\\Icons\\inv_shield_ironhorde_d_01:20|tHe used him to destroy hated family from within, not only tearing their bodies, but their spirit as well. When he returned to his kin, to share the revelation, he only met with his broked father - poor, hungry, lonely. They were outcasted from the village, and slowy died out, trying to survive. Enraged, and empowered by spirits of his ancestors he killed the Darkcaster, sealing his own fate of an outcast and a criminal. Thanks to the spirits guidance, he was able to find a way back to his father. In the last act of love, he killed him, freeing his powerful spirit from that useless body.\n\n|TInterface\\Icons\\inv_shield_ironhorde_d_01:20|tHe traveled far from his village, to live in peace and loneliness, talking to spirits and helping them to find peace, soon, some orcs reached him, for help, so he started to live from village to village, helping their residents to make peace with their ancestors, always having spirit of his father next to him, ready to advise him.\n\n|TInterface\\Icons\\inv_shield_ironhorde_d_01:20|tDreanai fanatics quickly started to hunt him, for his \"dark\" practices. They captured him, and tried to force him into the light, but he was broken out by some Mag'Har. While he was recovering from his wounds, Horde ambassadors came, and he found himself on the other side of the portal.\n\n|TInterface\\Icons\\inv_shield_ironhorde_d_01:20|tHe now resides in Eversong Woods and Ghostlands, communicating with spirits of fallen elves, trying to ease their pain. He visits Silvermoon only for a brief moments, to stock up, and use his abilities to heal for  some coin.\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-IronDocks:256:256}",

This changed quickly for the young fox when Korthek's minions swept across all of Vol'dun, taking any Vulpera they could find as prisoner - dead or alive. Vale stood to defend the outpost, but fell in battle. Of the fight, he retained a dangerous memento: the Sethraki blade that had been thrust through his chest.\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-paladin-cover:256:256}\n\n{h1:c}THE LION'S MERCY{/h1}\n\nHe recalled little from the time between the attack and the first time he was able to open his eyes since the sword was plunged into his chest. The blue flags that surrounded him told him plenty though: it was a camp controlled by soldiers of the Alliance. To his surprise, he wasn't bound by chains or behind the bars of a cage. His chest wound was covered by clean bandages, and beside him lay several similarly wounded soldiers. Humans, for the most part, but some dwarves, gnomes, and other kinds he was unable to recognize.\n\nA day, maybe two later, he found himself lying awake. A hooded man with the head of a wolf - a worgen, he'd heard - spoke to a human by the entrance to the tent, in a language he was unable to understand. They both pointed at him occasionally, and he could only wonder what grizzly fate awaited him.\n\nInstead, the human walked away, and the worgen drew closer, inspecting the wounds before following the human.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe didn't attempt an escape until he was able to stand up on his own again. His escape was foiled moments after it started; by the worgen no less. He stood ready to fight his way out, despite the obvious difference in size and bulk, but the worgen simply stood in his way, an amused grin spreading across his snout. He drew a dagger - big enough to be a small sword for the vulpera - and tossed it his way, before drawing a mace of his own.\n\nThe first swing was Vale's, striking the mace's handle, to be pushed away without a hint of effort from the worgen. The wolf swung with the broad side of the mace, which the vulpera just barely dodged. As they traded blows, the worgen seemed progressively more amused, until he finally grabbed the blade and yanked it right off of Vale's hand. Bruised and tired, the vulpera could do little more than protest. As (what Vale assumed to be) a token of good will, the worgen knelt, placing a hand on the largest gashes on the fox's body. The hand shone briefly... and the pain subsided. Once the hand moved away, there was no wound scarring the fur anymore. Unsure of what to make of this, the vulpera reevaluated his options. Suddenly, his bed in the medic tent seemed better than venturing out into the sands.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nMore spars took place over the next days. He was beginning to understand the language of the Alliance's forces a little better. He could recognize specific words. More vulpera came in, and not all of them left, their injuries too great. The humans looked weary from not just the desert, but also the war. There was more to this than he'd been led to believe by Horde couriers. He understood, above all else, that the sethrak offensive grew stronger by the day.\n\nFrom books borrowed by the soldiers, he learned (from the pictures, at least) about the \"righteous\" soldiers who embraced a power called \"the Light\". When he quizzed the few who visited his tent, even less were able to give him a proper answer. Its power still fascinated him.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe wasn't sure how long he'd stayed at this camp when he fell mysteriously ill. The mender at the settlement tried his best, but nothing seemed to make the vulpera's state improve. Finally, an unorthodox solution was found: he'd been given a blade, previously wrapped in thick cloth - the blade that had struck brought him to an inch of his life in the first place. Just like that, his health improved almost overnight.\n\nThe soldiers at the camp didn't seem to like that. He wasn't sure if it was the appearance of the jagged blade, or the fact that their captive had a weapon with him all the time now. His worgen 'mentor' saw past that, for reasons beyond his understanding. Over a few more days, when Vale's Common was developed enough, they had a proper conversation. He was told more about \"the Light\", and how it was the only way he would ever be able to survive wielding the weapon. When he queried him for hints on where to start searching, the worgen grew hesitant.\n\n\"Believe?\"\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe left the camp during a moonless night, when the guards were much too tired to either notice or chase him. He carried new armor and a small satchel full of supplies for the journey through the sands. The trek was nothing new to him - but it would be no less painful.\n\n\n{h2:c}{icon:inv_inscription_81_contract_honorbound:50}{/h2}\n\nThe fresh breeze of the port of Dazar'alor greeted him after days of travel, trade and bargains.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h2}OOC Note: The dagger is of void origin, and others capable of detecting such energy can detect it too. Vale -will- lose strength after too many days without it, such is the way it has become bound to his soul.{/h2}\n",

Turns out, I got one in a very unusual way!\n\nI was exploring the waters in Azshara, a fair distance from Bilgewater Harbor, when I spotted something laying deep in the water. It was heavily burnt and very rusty, but from the shape and size it was some kinda Mech. Finders keepers as the saying goes! This thing was gonna be mine. With the help of a druid friend and my mechanical scorpion we managed to pull the burnt wreck to shore. I pulled off all sorts of grime, gunk and crap from the remains and I could get a clear look at what exactly I have found. It was a Goblin Mech that was for sure, the design was a bit different from others though, yes it was missing the majority of its plating and was very rusty but something about it seemed different. \n\nI got to work looking over every inch of the Mech and towards the rear of the frame I spotted a serial number which read “XX00”, very unusual I thought to myself. From what I remember of serial numbers and mass production, serial numbers of XX00 usually are assigned to prototypes…could this be the prototype to all Goblin Mechs? Upon further inspection of the Mech I could see the majority of its wiring and gears were intact, if a little rusty, so this thing could be repaired…it would just take a lot of time.\n\nI dragged my Mech to an area of Azshara I know no one goes to and hid it under a few rocks. I compiled a list of everything I would need to repair it. It needed new plating which meant I would need a lot of metal, the gears and wiring need cleaning and testing, it would need a new core…oh and finally a fresh coat of paint. \n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-horde-TransformAzermek:256:128}\n{h2:c}Restoration and Reconstruction{/h2}\n\n{h3}Week 1{/h3}\nI decided to try my best to get the Mech moving, as I think it would be fairly simple to do with a temporary power core. I erm...” acquired” a power core that was used to power…well honestly, I don’t know, I just found it in a pile of junk! I cleaned up the gears and wiring as best as I could and connected the power core, pressed the ignition button and ran to hide (ya know just in case the thing went boom!). I peeked from behind a rock and saw the Mech didn’t explode! It was standing there in all its rusty glory. I hopped in the frame, where I had assembled a very crude and simple cockpit, and tested to see if it could move. Success! It could move and with some speed…yea sure it was very noisy as it still had a lot of rust that needed removing, but who cares for now!\n\n{h3}Week 2{/h3}\nWell, seems the Mech was in worse shape than I thought! Every 4th step the right leg would seize up and become very hard to move. I decided what the heck, might as well strip the legs down to their basic parts and take a looksie at what’s going on. Inside the legs I saw the gears were slightly bent out of shape causing them to grind and stick, fixing the gears would be a pain…maybe I could steal…I mean…”find” some new ones! I summoned my robot pal Blaster and asked him to scan each gear “beep boop beep” he said, which I assume meant yes. With the gears scanned it was time to hunt down suitable replacements, first stop was Gnomeregan. \n\nOk, what the hell! Lazy ass Gnomes, their home is still a freakin’ mess! Scratch that then, I did hear someone talk about a “Junk Heap” in Tiragarde and getting there would be easy. I hoped on a Horde boat that was heading to Kul Tiras and luck would have it they were stopping off at Tiragarde. “Captain I am on orders from Gallywix himself to secure materials to help the war effort!” that’s the lie I told the Captain, and it worked like a charm! I suppose the fact I was boarding the ship with 3 mechanical creations (Kay Nine, Blaster and Scorpinator) might have made the Captain think I must be super important!\n\nAs soon as we made port and hopped on Scorpinator and made my way to the “Junk Heap”. Oh boy! When I arrived, I was in heaven. Junk? Who the hell calls all this Junk!? It’s treasure! Everywhere I looked, gears, cogs, scraps of metal…everything an Engineer could need! Blaster got to work scanning the area and finding suitable gears, while I chilled and played with Kay Nine and Bandit. Eventually we had a complete set of gears and some spares, I loaded them onto a box I had attached to Scorpinator and sent it along with Kay Nine and Blaster back to the nearest Horde camp. I wanted one last look over the place before I left, that’s when I saw it! A miniature Titan Power Core! Oh, come on, no one needs this surely…I grabbed the core and as I did alarms began to blaze!\n\nCrud! I thought as I picked the core up, mechanical growls could be heard from all around me. And then they appeared, mechanical cats and dogs way bigger than me…with glowing eyes and sharp teeth. “Erm…Easy guys I am just gonna take this core and be on my way!” As I moved the core closer to my bag the growls became louder! Screw it, I thought. I grabbed Bandit put him on my shoulders, pocketed the core and ran…ran as fast as I could…ran so fast I didn’t even stop until I ran straight into a Horde camp.\n\nWhen I got back to Azshara, where I had left my Mech before this “epic” adventure, I quickly replaced all the gears and noticed that these were far superior to the previous ones, they moved together a lot smoother and cleaner. As I was replacing the gears, I also noticed power cords that ran to the feet. Holy crap! This Mech…it must be capable of Flight! I connected all the power cords I found into a simple power distribution board, that I had found quite sometime ago but never found a use for, I placed the Titan Power Core into the centre of the Mech and connected it to the board. I jumped into the Mech and pressed the ignition button. Success! The Mech walked without any issues and the flight engines in the feet they worked, ok they only would work for a short amount of time before the warning alarm would sound and then the Titan Power Core would shut off…but who cares for now! \n\n{h3}Week 3{/h3}\nWeapons! What’s the point of having an awesome Mech and having nothing that can go Boom! I ain’t no weaponsmith or anything…so making them is out of the question, finding stuff is what I’m good at though! And I know where there are loads of Canons, Mortars, Guns…everything, a place no one dares go…The Undercity, well more specifically outside.\n\nI journeyed to where the great battle took place, well to the outskirts of course I’m not stupid. With my various Mechanical companions at my side, I knew I could do this. I instructed Blaster and Kay Nine to enter the toxic area and scan for any working (or nearly working) weapons. After a wait of a few hours (I swear those two probably got lost in the ruins) they came back to me and reported of several weapons that could be salvaged. “Great!” I thought as I rubbed my hands together, I ordered Scorpinator to follow them both back in and salvage whatever it could and bring it back to me. \n\nThree hours! Three frick’n hours I waited. When they emerged, I saw the goodies they had found; two large canons, one long-distance mortar canon, four rocket launchers and two rapid firing guns. I thought I would get some strange looks as I travelled with such strange cargo, but no one seemed to notice nor care! \n\nWhen I eventually got back to Azshara, where I had left my Mech, I spent quite sometime inspecting each of the weapons to check they were in some kinda working order. Everything was in working order, except one of the guns which seemed to be jammed and wouldn’t fire…ah well! I spent most of the evening attaching the weapons to the Mech and wiring them directly to the Titan power core. On the back of the Mech I attached to two large canons, the long-distance mortar I placed directly in the middle of the back and the only working gun I attached to its left shoulder. As for the rockets I attached two launchers to each of its forearms. I stepped back and admired my work, sure the Mech was still missing its hull plating so a lot of the insides were exposed but man…it looked so bad ass! \n\nI hopped in my Mech, pressed the various buttons and switches to activate the systems and smiled as each of the new guns came online. “ERROR, ERROR” flashed on a small screen “UNSTABLE POWER OVERLOAD!”, that’s not good I thought to myself and pressed buttons to shutdown the Mech. “SHUTDOWN ERROR!” No…No…NO! This is NOT good, I thought as I jumped off the Mech and frantically pulled all the wiring from the Titan core. I looked at my various companions and yelled at them “Get the frick outta here now guys!”, they all scampered away to a nearby cave. I continued to rip all the wires from the core, but it was too late. The core began to glow brighter and brighter, it was going to explode! I grabbed the core with my bare hands and yelled as the core burnt my hands, I ran as fast as I could to the nearby shore and threw the core with all my strength into the water and ran back to my Mech and hid behind it. Nothing happened…No earth shattering kaboom, no nothing. I stood up and dusted myself down and blew on my burnt hands “What the frick…where’s the Ka…” as I spoke there was a very loud explosion that sent water shooting into the air and knocked me right on my butt! I inspected my Mech and sighed “looks like I need a new power core…” \n\n{h3}Week 4{/h3}\nPower cores don’t just grow on trees and the last one I found by sheer luck. I could go back to the same scrapheap and see if get lucky again…or I could make a core, how hard could it be? I have lots of scraps of metal and junk, surely I can make SOMETHING from all that. I headed back to the cave in Azshara where I had been storing all my stuff. I searched through all the boxes and gathered everything I thought would be useful and I also made myself a sandwich because ya can’t science on an empty stomach! As I ate my sandwich, Cheese and some kinda Fish in case you are wondering, I suddenly remembered. “Azerite!” I had stashed away a nice supply of Azerite from when this whole war started, I had done a few experiments but nothing too crazy. I searched towards the back of the cave and I found it, the large metal box I had stored my Azerite in. One very large Azerite Crystal and six relatively small shards. Perfect!\n\nI sat down with my box of scraps, wires and Azerite and began to think. Azerite is unstable when used improperly, it is also highly explosive…great care will need to be taken if I am to make a working core. I took my hammer and hit the large Azerite Crystal hard, nah I’m kidding! I took some pieces of metal and bent it into a circular shape, placed the small shards on top and wrapped a combination of Copper, Gold and Trillium wires around each piece of Azerite and connected a variety of switches in between the pieces. So why did I do this? Basically, I arranged it this way so the Mech would use one shard first and then as it needs more power the switches would trigger connecting the second shard, then the third etc. Pretty amazing right? So, what was I gonna do about the larger Azerite Crystal? Well, I attached a few pieces of metal to the bottom to form a base, and connected a variety of wires close to the Azerite and then added a few gears to the bottom. Why did I do this? Simple really, what will happen is when I need more power the gears will activate and press the wiring directly onto the larger Azerite Crystal and begin to draw power and when I don’t need more power the wires will retract back a bit. Aint Goblin science grand! \n\nI grabbed the Dual Azerite core system and ran to my Mech. I giggled as I wired everything up and I also attached a small rocket to the bottom of the new core, so if ever an overload happened again, I could eject the core. It didn’t take too long to wire everything up, no where near as long as before. I jumped in my Mech and pressed all the buttons to bring it online and checked the status lights and screen. Everything was green! Meaning everything was AWESOME! I giggled with so much glee as I ran around Azshara in my Mech…I should have been looking where I was going as I bumped right into a very large Naga army! I totally forgot those buttheads still hang around here…\n\nI pressed the buttons to engage the flight system and flew up in the air and I was about to fly away…when I thought “Maybe it’s time to test the Weapons!”. I giggled more as I pressed the buttons to bring the weapons online. “ERROR…ERROR!” not again! The Mech suddenly shut down while I was in the air! Oh crap…The Mech fell as I frantically hit every button which did NOTHING!  I was so mad that I hit my head hard against the controls, which caused everything to come back online and the weapons to become active! “Hell yea…”, I breathed in deeply and flew down close to the Naga and before I fired a single shot, I did what anyone would do at a time like this…I turned on my Goblin Radio and blasted out some tunes! My Mech flew all around the Naga, firing off missiles in every direction and the gun made a great sound as it shot at all the Naga in my way. I flew back to my cave in Azshara and cackled like crazy…I had just built an Azerite core…in a cave…with a box of scraps.\n\n{h3}Week 5{/h3}\nSo, this Mech needs a lot of metal and I mean a lot…we ain’t talkin’ one or two sheets of metal! We are talkin’ like err I dunno exactly! I have been collecting a few scraps of metal here and there on my travels and I have been erm…”salvaging” metal from some of the Horde structures but it still isn’t going to be enough. Oh, so yea if you see any Horde buildings or anything missing large pieces of metal, it wasn’t me ok? \n\nI was walking around Orgrimmar when suddenly it hit me! No really, a large sheet of metal hit me…hurt really bad and knocked me off my feet. When I eventually got back onto my feet, a peon was apologising to me and asked me if I knew where the foreman wanted the metal delivered to. I looked to see several peons carrying metal sheets under their arms. “Of course I know! I am a Goblin and an engineer for the Horde, the foreman wants the metal delivered to a small cave in Azshara”, yea so I lied to some peons but ya know I am part of the Horde so technically them giving me the metal is helping the Horde as a whole. \n\nAfter the peons finished delivering the metal, I carefully counted how many sheets I had and combining it with the parts I had salvaged I calculated I had enough to finish fixing up the external and internal plating of the Mech…I just had no idea how I would get all this metal welded onto the Mech. I sought advice from a Blackrock Orc who told me that welding metals on a large scale is easy using machinery and conveyor belts, “well that’s just great…but I don’t have any of that!” I yelled at him. He shrugged at me and said that a fire mage could probably weld the metals together, I smiled as I knew a certain mage who owed me a few favours. \n\nI met my mage friend in my small cave and told him exactly what he needed to do. While he worked on welding the sheets of metals together, I sorted through the scraps of metals and ores that I had gathered. I had a few chunks of gold and titanium and I had a genius of an idea I could use these to make an alloy that I could cover vital parts and joints in which will help with heat management! I am so gosh damn smart when I need to be! I placed the chunks into a pot and told the mage to superheat the pot, the chunks of metal and the pot melted and oozed onto the floor…well I guess that works. With the help of the mage, we managed to get the alloy off the floor and majority of the welding had been completed. \n\n“Here take this hammer, and help me bend the metals into shape!”, the mage promptly threw the hammer at my head and stormed out. Fine, I will do it myself…can’t be that hard. CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, was the sound that could be heard throughout my cave as I hammered all the metal sheets into various bends and shapes to fit better onto my Mech. After what must have been a good few days, all the metals were formed into the right shapes and I began to place them onto the Mech’s body. Gold-Titanium alloy was used to re-enforce the joints, to cover parts of the guns and canons and around the Azerite core. I borrowed a welding torch from one of the Blackrock Orcs, well ok borrowed without asking…whatever. I welded the sheets of metals onto the mech as best as I could ensuring they were bonded to the Mech and wouldn’t fall off. After a full week of work my Mech finally had hull plating of shiny new metal, it was starting to look even more badass now! Just needs a coat of paint and some fine tuning and it will be done!\n\n{h3}The Final Week{/h3}\nSo, yea, I may have put finishing my Mech on the back burner as they say…But hey! I had so much crap going on lately! There is a War going on ya know, well if you didn’t know then wow you must live in a cave with your fingers in your ears or somethin’! \n\nAnyways, Gazlowe came to me and asked for my help in a place called “Mechagon”. I have heard of this place; it’s meant to be a myth…a legend! But all this time its been just off the coast of Kul Tiras, who’d a thunk it! I agreed to help Gazlowe, he just isn’t the kinda Goblin you say no to really. Off to Mechagon I went, with my Mech of course. Man, the stuff I saw in Mechagon…I can’t even begin to tell ya the stuff that’s there, its Engineering heaven! I helped Gazlowe and his team with research, development and other tasks to help the Horde and took my fair share of whatever we found to help with my Mech….What!? No! For once I didn’t steal anything, I was given the OK to take what I needed for my Mech as we have been using it quite a lot in excavating in Mechagon. \n\nThose Robo-Gnomos, the Mechagnomes, kept looking at my Mech and suggest improvements and systems that should be added. I had to keep shooing them away, aint no gnome…even half a gnome touching my Mech! So, with all the stuff I found in Mechagon I vastly improved my Mech. I have added so many improvements its insane. \n\nI added a security system, so only myself or someone I authorise can pilot my Mech, if you get in and you aren’t authorised you get a nice electric shock…ZAP! \n\nMy Mech now has a powerful Self Destruct, just in case I ever get into a situation where I need to use it! Of course I haven’t tested it…what are you dumb!? Anyways to activate it you say the passcode which is….ha! nice try, I aint telling you!\n\nParty Mode is something I just HAD to add. When activated, large speakers from in my Mech will blast music at crazy loud volumes and the lights on it will flash making for a nice little Disco…even in times of War there is ALWAYS time to Party! \n\nThe final thing I did with my Mech in Mechagon was finally paint it. Turns out Mechagon has a painting station, why? Heck if I know! But it was perfect for my needs. I cleaned up my Mech as best as I could and selected the colour I wanted, a nice dark blue. I mixed some small shavings of metal into the paint mix to give it a slight sparkle when light hits it, hey its MY Mech and I want it looking fancy! I sprayed all of the body in this blue paint and painted the weapons and some of the trims in a nice silver colour. The final touch was to add some skulls, because skulls make anything look badass! I had some left-over gold, which I melted down and moulded into some cool looking skull shapes and then welded them the shoulders and body of my Mech (I made 4 in total) \n\nAnd BOOM! My Mech was finally finished! The Alliance…no wait…AZEROTH better watch out for Slacker and her…\n{h2:c}{col:003ba8}\nMechanised \nElectrostatic \nCritical\nHyper \nAttack \nSystem\neXtra Large Robot {/col}{/h2}",
