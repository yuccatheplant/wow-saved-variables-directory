Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

She got her name from her parents when she was just a kid as she was talking to the fishes in the bucket her father caught in the early morning, and it was used as a pun as all she wanted to eat was Chips therefore 'Fish & chips' was born.\n\nShe grown up in a very aestetic education, coming from an average family she didn't had any chance to pursue any kind of wealthy action, she never travelled, not that she felt the need to; for her travelling was a few blocks away, she often sneaked into Salty Sailor Tavern by night time. She listened to the tales of the different sailor and adventurers and that fulfilled her head with dreams and hopes for the future to become a sailor herself.\n\nAlthought things went differently...\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-ThroneofKiljaeden:512:256}\n{h1:c}The curse{/h1}\n{p:c}{col:ff201b} \"I'm scared to talk to you... But even more scared to turn my back on you\"{/col}{/p}\n\nYears passed, Katherine grown up and slowly her dream of becoming a sailor slowly fade away as a kid memory, she was a smart woman and helped her parents with the accounting and the haggling at the fish market, She started to talk her way inside the inn, speaking to the adventurers and learning more about the world that was surrounding the north of the eastern Kingdom, she learned about the wars, the plague. and eventually on the doomed day of:\n {col:ff2e33}Tuesday 7th December{/col}, Deathwing, unleashed his wrath upon Azeroth. destroying partially Booty bay and making everything she knew at that time collapse. and she witnessed herself the destructive powers of the Black dragon...\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-FallofDeathwing:100:100}{p:c}{col:ff201b} \"The world .... is torched...\"{/col}{/p}\n\n...there was an enormous explosion. Despite Chips being indoor, the blast was so powerful it propelled her across the room, the window shattered in hundred of sharp glass ore. the roar of the beast, deafening, made her ears screech in a high-pitched ringing. The flames, the smoke, she couldn't bear such an intense emotion and eventually collapsed unconscious.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-MOLTENCORE:100:100}{p:c}{col:ff201b} \"My lungs ... are smoking and my skin is melting.\"{/col}{/p}\n\nA few minutes later, she woke up, her body completely numb, she looked around only too see the horror around her, not a single person remained untouched. Only half the houses of the village remained standing and they are crowded with grieving and panicking survivors. She was one of them, one of the dispossessed, relying on luck, people started to scarvenge everything they could get their hands on. She saw peoples walking over her, grabbing her family belongings before vanishing outside running.\n\nBut someone didn't leave, a silhouette, a stunningly beautiful woman. appeared from the smoke clouds, Her voluptuous form is squeezed into what seemed to be a tight leather-bodice. Large bat wings unfurl from her back. She walked closer to Chips her footsteps of her hooves clopping on the wood floor sending what felt like to be earthquakes to the core of the weak human on the ground. She stopped in front of chips and looked down on her.\n{p:c}__________________________________________________________{/p}\n\n{p:r}Dying, so young? must be a shame : {icon:Spell_Shadow_SummonSuccubus:25}{/p}\n{icon:Achievement_Character_Human_Female:25} : {col:06ff24}\n*couldn't respond anything, she was too weak and scared for her life*{/col}\n\n\n{p:r}{col:06ff24}\n*giggles lightly*{/col}\n Tell me, Would you like me to end your suffering ? : {icon:Spell_Shadow_SummonSuccubus:25}{/p}\n\n{icon:Achievement_Character_Human_Female:25} : {col:06ff24}\n*eyes widened and her body started to have spasms from the terror she felt*{/col}\n\n\n{p:r}{col:06ff24}\n*her facial expression turned into a grin*{/col}\n               \nOr maybe you'd like to live a bit longer? : {icon:Spell_Shadow_SummonSuccubus:25}{/p}\n\n{icon:Achievement_Character_Human_Female:25} : {col:06ff24}\n*Her body shaking was unable to physically respond but she looked in the splitted eyes of the demon, staring.*{/col}\n\n\n{p:r}{col:06ff24}\n*She approached her head closer to hers and winked*{/col}\n               \nYou know, making a pact with a demon have a price, and looking at your situation, You are not in any position to barga , the kind of prey that i love.

It made her power drunk and now she's often on the lookout for a new subject to abuse.\n\n<< I really like the idea of developing a character over time.

Her physiognomy often mirrors the ill omen that swathes her unscrupulous disposition. Altruism and sympathy stand foreign concepts to Jhenvieve, for her pedigree often compels her to appraise everything with a pragmatic state of mind. Two refined strips of hair, akin to red clusters of vibrissae, line the ridge above two hereditary orbs of amber. Her ineptitude to fathom sympathy fails to eclipse the prospect of boasting impeccable aesthetics. \n\nPlatonically, Jhenvieve’s beguiling elegance and grace testify to her stature as a socialite. Maquillage often swathes Jhenvieve’s countenance, veiling the scarce imperfections she bears beyond a nigh-translucent tapestry of colourful cosmetics. Whilst by no means a connoisseur of beauty, Jhenvieve’s appearance is indubitably sublime. An auburn mane of tresses sits at the pinnacle of her silhouette, bracketing her countenance betwixt a chasm of ever-shifting strands of hair.\n\nJhenvieve’s hellbent on perfection in every aspect and her physique isn’t an exception. Rigorous physical activity compels the woman’s musculature to maintain her athletic build. She’s by no means gargantuan, yet underestimating the unbridled force of the impact she’s liable to deliver could turn catastrophical for the recipient of her ire. She bears a curvaceous silhouette, in spite of her athleticism. \n\nJhenvieve’s armaments are arguably sharper than the juvenile wit of a court jester. Her girdle is encompassed with a various assortment of weaponry. An intricately forged dagger engraved with obscure glyphs resides within a scabbard, embroidered by an illustrious craftsman’s hand. She’s also equipped with an obsidian pionard, spanned betwixt the circular silhouette of the coiled viper she often brandishes. Augmented pouches, presumably containing a plethora of inanimate objects are firmly knotted to her girdle. Last but definitely not least, a hollow tube often oscillates with her gallivanting. It’s fastened to her girdle as well. \n\nJhenvieve’s frequently encompassed with a collection of illustrious trinkets. Quintessential craftsmanship was evidently paramount to craft Andeaur’s ring. A protruding ridge of silver illustrates a bevelled projection of a bleak tree, encompassed by a squircle plaque of obsidian minerals. It gradually transitions into a golden circle, designed to fit Jhenvieve’s finger. A triangle socket orbits around an exquisite gem of ruby furthermore connected to a silver chain, boosting her prodigal decorum with unnecessarily flamboyant flair.  \n",

There is no doubt he has seen a life with quite a bit of physical labour, but with that said, he is clearly not the kind to bear heavy armour and a shield - A type who prefers swiftness and agility over sheer strength in terms of combat, perhaps.\n\nHis visage is aged and worn by the long years on the road and evident struggles. The scars lingering on his face being a testament to just that. He is generally calm and friendly, most often seen with a fairly composed expression with a pair of dull grey eyes wandering curiously about.\n\nIrwin's hair and beard are both a dirty blonde colour. Neither appears to be very well-kept, perhaps groomed now and again. Lazily. But generally just a tousled mess, really. The man's complexion appears to be a tad tanned. There is no question about this fellow being an outdoorsman. {/col}{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{link*https://imgur.com/a/Pn9ToYm*Art!}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}",

Jackson did his best to protect the still living people of Lorderon, seeing the chaos and rise of new factions. He saw the silver hands fate, the spawning of the scarlet crusade and much more.\nAnd then, a fateful day. Foolish passion brought him to a fight he couldn’t win, he was cut down.

He Sacrificed everything to aid people escape from the scourge.\nBut his sacrifices didn’t let him have peace, it only brought him into the thrall of the lich king.\n\nAnd it’s Thrall he stayed, until the rebellion of the Ebon blades. And in their numbers he went, fighting in their case, even staying with them for a time.\nBut due to arthas being gone, he eventually struck out on his own.

A series of traits which often easily drown within an endless sea of haughtiness. By no means shallow or lacking in wit, rather she chooses her points of interest well.\n\n\nPracticality refined to an alluring beauty, the elf knows that some things are better kept simplistic, lacking in the need to be improved upon. Be it the well made armour that often covers her form, the neatly tied alabaster hair, or lips accentuated by just a touch of violet. \n\n\nPhysically fit and beyond able. Strong legs with defined arms and shoulders to match them, her craft is easy to figure out. If the bow, which rarely strays too far, doesn't do just that to begin with. Still, there's more than meets the eye - A recurring theme when it comes to the woman. An aura of the arcane betrays a leaning towards the arts which were still recently forbidden to many. {/col}\n\n",

One he had recovered, Daelin Proudmoore had fallen and Kul Tiras soon left the ranks of the Alliance, leaving Caleb Atterbury to continue his life at his home, Stormsong Valley.\n\nShortly before the events of the Fourth War, Caleb Atterbury left the ranks of the Tideguard under House Stormsong, like many of his brothers and sisters amongst the Tidesages as well, he had began to sense a great, looming darkness from the depths. Once loyal enough to lay his life and future down at the feet of House Stormsong, Atterbury did not waste a moment to join the Storm's Wake once it was formed, to put a end to this perversion of something so many of his people believed in.\n\nAfter the fall of Lord Stormsong, the once gentle man that had been twisted and corrupted by the whispers of the depths, Atterbury returned to active service under House Proudmoore, fighting  his way amongst many others through Dazar'alor and barely surviving the events that unfolded at Nazjatar.\n\nAs the Fourth War came to it's conclusion and the Alliance and Horde formed their armistice, Atterbury could not simply return back to his peaceful life, without battle, without a cause or war to fight. The man now seeks to teach and guide others down a very similar path as his own, to learn what it means to be a soldier, what it means to have convictions and what truly matters to one in the end.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Links{/h2}\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/242748*Argent Archives + Art.}",

He would constantly wander of in to the forest and get in to trouble which the guards would constantly have to save him from. His parents wanted him to inherit the farm but they realised that would never happen.\n\n So after many uyears of thinking they decided to send him off to his uncle who lived in stormwind who was a retired mercenery. His uncle started training him in many differnt types of weapons but Draxxos who had worked at a farm his entire life so far was quite strong which made him gravitate towards twohanders like greatswords battleaxes and polearms. So they became his favroites however he was also pretty good at duel weilding onehanders. His uncle saw great promise in Draxxos after many years of training he gave Draxxos his old armor and weapons and told him to find a his first contract.\n\nThis Draxxos did and his first contract was to kill a evil necromancer which was said to live in loch modan so Draxxos took a gryphon there. After three weeks of serching hw found the necromancers hideout. Thinking what to do he sneaked in to the best of his ability but the necromancer spoted him and thwey fought for a good while until Draxxos finally killed her. After this Draxxos looked around at all the stuff she had and found a rune which glowed blood red and icey blue and so he picked it up and it directly shatterd in his hand blue and red energy surged in to his eyes and he blacked out.\n\nWhen he woke he was able to use ice and blood magic it took many years and at the age of 30 after countless contracts he was finally able to control his magical abililaties. Ever since then he has been and still is a mercenary.\n\nEventually Draxxos parents died. At the age of 35 he inherited there farm but since he did not like the farmers life and did grow up most of his youth in stormwind he instead of working there he hired workers who pays him by working there and in return get to live there for free.\n",

Most... Comming to his personality, he doesnt like to be pushed arround by people he does not deem worhty of his respect. and can act quite agressive if provoked to an extent its no longer endurable for the Deathknight. However on the upper side, he's a loyal companion once you earned his respect and trust and would make sure those who seek harm on them, would pay.. with their souls.\n\n{h3:c}History{/h3}\n\nBefore his Undeath:\n\nSetharo was an aspiring Soldier of the Sentinal infantry of Astranar his skills with the sword were quickly reconized by his comrades in arms and praised him even his rival Valthares Moonblade who was one squad higher than he was... Astranaar had been in his lifetime at peace.. One day  then however came something he'd had never saw coming.. The Sisterhood of Elune ordered the Sentinel-Army of Astranaar to move their forces to Dragonblight to fight the Scourge. Many of his comerades were confident with Setharo on their side they'd have great chances.. however.... Setharo found his end by a Vrykul that pierced his chest with a Sword. The Lichking commanded his minions to gather the corpses that had fallen in the battle before Putris betrayal. Setharo being one of them.. after he was brought to the Necromancers to be revived.. Putris betrayal begun.. thousands of people died because of the Plague. Setharo was risen.. brought back to life as a weapon of destruction and death.. a Deathnknight. His memories were completly wiped out.. or better said clouded as the Lichking controlled him.. commanded him to do horrible things.\n\nDuring his time as Servant of the Lich King:\n\nDuring the time of his undeath.. Setharo did not remember a thing, and followed the commands of the Lich King blindly, killing anyone who dared to stand against his way and thus of his Master. During the time he was risen, he had to learn first how to controll the dark powers granted him by the Necromancers that ressurected him. His tests with the three Arts of the Deathknights, led him to his decision to become a Knight of Frost, a Soldier of the Frozen Throne.  In time he became stronger and more powerfull with this school, that the high-ups among the Scourge recomennded him as a Lieutenent in Icecrown, which came true. But his career came quickly to an end, as the Ebon Blade marched towards Icecrown he was defeated by an Commander of the Ebon Blade, however he didnt kill Setharo.. as Setharo was near his 2nd death.. the controll of the Lichking faded upon him. The Commander gave him an ultimatum; Either join the Ebon Blade and betray his master. Or die by his hand. As Setharo saw finnaly clear not being controlled by Arthas, he joined Forces with the Ebon Blade, promising himself that he'd restore his honor no matter the cost. He joined the assault on Icecrown Citadel, and was one of the very few who came as far as to challenge Arthas atop of Icecrown Citadel, however the killing blow was not Setharo's to deal with, as Tirion Fordring did the finishing blow against Arthas, ending his reign of terror.\n\nDuring the times of the Cataclysmic, Pandaria and Draenor Campagin, Setharo wasnt active, he was stationed at Acherus, standing by..\n\nReturn of the Burning Legion:\nSetharo joined the Assault on the Broken Shore, only to find himself outnumbered by the vast amount of demons, luckily an Ebon Comerade managed to pull him off the fray just in time, as they retreated to Acherus for a counteratack. Months Later, when the Tomb of Sargeras opened, Setharo was within the assaul force of the Legionfall faction, that was founded at the time by Khadgar and the other leaders of the factions. Setharo's bitter hatred for the Demons still lingered in his soul, as he cleaved every single one of them that came across his path, as he and his assault force marched into the Tomb. His Group was able to get to the Chamber of the Avatar, but he was ordered back to the entrance, to let the others handle the rest from this point on. Still, the desire to have been able to witness Kil'jaedens Downfall was there, sadly for him, it wasnt meant to be. \nOnce Argus was abou to be invaded by the Armies of Azeroth, he too joined the assault on the once Pridefull and beautifull Planet of the Draenei. Countless Demons fell victim to his runeblade, as they reached Antorus, his assault Group was assigned to keep the Breach into the Legion Fortress open, so others could invade it.. yet again, the Glory of Ending the Legion, was denied to him. But he was satisfied that the Legion was about to find its end.. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Given the thrustworthyness of Charles Blackmane and his approach to conduct business, the ship and its crew always flew underneath the radar of the more civilized ports. His reputation of being a great, lawbinding citizen and captain earned the trust of the alliance navy and its port keepers.\n\nHowever, Charles was a cunning Gilean lad. He always found a extra source of income, which enchanted his crew's loyalty. Yet not enough to betray him down the line as his trusted Quartermaster, known as Nathan Furcoat. Engaged in conspiracy and the motion of rising a mutiny aboard his ship by the promise of claiming -more- income then what their current captain ever could. \n\nNathan, given his vast years at sea. Had established contact with a man called Coiled by visiting one of his brothels close to the shore, which eventually brought out a business purposal. By serving his enterprise by smuggling his goods through The Mayflower, they'd gain far more than their ordinary trade could. Thus was Nathan's plot further fueled, now backed up by the financial investment from Tricky business. \n\nAfter Nathan secured the loyalty of all the crew, he himself placed the dagger in Charles back. While his corpse ran cold, Nathan had his former captain' attire deprived from his body before having it dumped into the vast depth of the ocean. While he gazed onto the fading image of his former captain, being devoured by the black sea. He'd take on his identity as his own by wearing the same attire as Charles.\n\nThe resemblance was questionable, yet less so after he copied the same scar Charles had across his right eye. Carved by the steady motion of his own hand and trusted knife, Nathan ensured the resemblance to be unquestionable. By bribing and threatning those who knew him and the former captain, he'd secure his new future as the Captain of the Mayflower!",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

(Steel)\n\nRunic Incendiary Ammunition - Shellls made for his shotgun, upon being fired the pieces of hot Dark Iron reach critical temperature. Runes encarved into them make them catch aflame and remain aflame. This will make it hard to cease the flames through normal means.\n\nFaerie Blood Dipped Ammunition - The creme of all anti-magic weaponry. Shells drenched in Faerie Blood. Faerie Blood is one of the most powerful means to disenchant or dispell powerful enchantments or spells. A bullet dipped in Faerie Blood will make it absolutely impossible for a magic user to make us of his mana once it enters his blood stream. The effect should wear off as soon as his body fights off the foreign blood.Until that happens casting spells will be extremely difficult and gathering or utilizing enough mana of your own to form a new spell will be a work of art even for a skilled mage.{/col}\n\n\n\n{col:0edeee}[Plate Armor Modifications]\nGloves have built  in hardened knuckles that make it easier to beat the absolutely holy hell out of somebody with them. Deadly to unarmored opponents.\n\n\n{/col}\n\n{col:0edeee}[Special Weapons]\n\nRazor Trap Kit - A kit of razor sharp glass that upon activation will spring under pressure of steam from internal valves. This is a silent and deadly weapon. It will usually not lead to death quickly, rather bleeding out an opponent. The kit will activate upon  receiving external pressure. This includes being tossed and hitting an enemy. (Being grabbed or stepped on will also trigger it.]\n\nExplosive Mine - Based upon the old design of a goblin mine. It is a small portable form of a goblin mine that can be attachted to any surface due to a series of little hooks that can with pressure dig into anything from flesh to stone. They'll hack into an object and stick to it before exploding. The explosion is remotely triggered as the internal mechanism needs to be released connecting the main chamber with the internal flame that'll set off the explosive.\n\nSmoke Screen - A small tool that starts to release steam out of itself creating after a few moments a relatively succesful smoke screen in enclosed areas. Perfect against ranged cowards\n\nUsually armed with a maximum of five explosives. Strapped to the back of cloak.\n.{/col}\n\n\n\n{col:0edeee}[Rare and Unique Designs] \n\nUsually based around the materials existing in the world. Not used for the most part except a few blueprints.\n\nBlueprint #001 - A close proximity disengage mine. It is a small, circular object with an arcanite core. Overloaded with energy to be used as a way to push yourself and the opponent back. Design was far too expensive for a weapon that hurts both yourself and the opponent. Final opinion on the weapon : It could be used if given a larger format and used as a way to send a shockwave of energy at a targeted direction. But this would require a stationary more powerful reserve of energy.\n\nBlueprint #002 - An Arcane Assault Rifle. As the name suggests it is a rifle with a rapid fire potential that would send projectiles of arcane energy through an already present rifle. This would make it far more efficient than conjuring a spell and then targetting it. The rifle would have a simple arcanite core (alternatively another object able to hold arcane energy) that would allow for the dispersion of energy down the barrel of the gun.  Project scrapped due to the small and weak effect of projectiles. Note: A single fire powerful rifle is possible. Yet due to its single shot nature it is not as beneficial. \n\nPrototype #001 \"Arcane Shield\" - Prototype \"Arcane Shield\" is a set of arcanite crystals, placed within or attached to an object. It is possible for shields, armor and even certain types of weaponry.  The basis of the shield is rather simple. A set of loaded arcanite crystals lined or attached to certain parts of your equipment allow for the rapid dispersion of energy causing a disrupting arcane blast of energy to appear outwards from your person. The power of this disruption is based around the level of energy contained within the crystals and their amount. As this shield would be useless if the discharge ended up hurting the user due to the nature of the discharge as it would be like an explosion. The crystal would always need to be placed within your equipment with the internal side, either warded or blocked off with heavily magic-resistant material. Allowing for the energy dispersed in that direction to return to the crystal. Causing a form of recycling of the energy that would cycle between the wards/magic resistant material right back into the crystal which would at that point be empty and re-contain the energy.\n\nAlternatively, The Arcane Shield is an answer to a magic users Mana Shield. It is a mimic of that ability. By enchanting your gear it is possible for the energy to be released not as an explosion but as a buffer. A layer of energy that would stick to your form and outline it. As long as the shield would have energy it would remain active. Since it is pressing against your form it would not cause the energy to disperse by itself. With enough blunt trauma or good surface damage though the shield will fade and the crystals will remain uncharged.\n\nCurrently in use on character, word for activation : Rex.\n\n{/col}\n",

Magic balances the scales where physique cannot.\"{/col}{/h2}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:90e6ff}================================{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}Standing a hair below most human women, it's Herridan's golden hair that tends to draw the eye rather than his stature. Trimmed to his shoulders and styled to the side to leave his eyes unobscured, the blond strands can be seen rebelling when a wind blows much to the mage's chagrin. Thin brows topping his hazel eyes, a slim and upturned nose at the centre of his face leaves the high cheekbones and slim jawline to frame Dani's expression. Bee-stung lips completing his facial features, albeit a shade darker than the rest of his tanned complexion and often curled into a welcoming smile.\n\nSlim neck leading down to a pair of slender shoulders begin the frame for the thaumaturge's physique. Lithe, toned arms lacking the meat and muscle of his armour-toting counterparts in the Alliance military, alongside a slimmer chest, makes Dani seem diminutive by comparison. His flat chest and abdomen hold little meat or chub to them, the latter offering the faintest hint of the musculature hidden beneath his smooth complexion if the lighting is kind.\n\nBelow his narrow waist is where Dani's unique silhouette really begins to take shape. Long legs that make up the majority of his lacking height stretch above his dainty feet. A penchant for sandals and stockings of thin fabric make his painted blue toenails shine through most outfits, with his calves and shins gradually widening as they rise towards his knees. Above the dexterous joints most of Herridan's weight seems to be distributed.\n\nBodacious in their femininity, Herridan's hips have drawn many an envious eye from the ladies of his kind. The smooth, rounded curves of plumpness that comprise his hips provide rationale for his thick leather belts. Sloping so starkly it's hard to imagine any cloth clinging to the narrow waist above unaided. Inkeeping with the voluptuous frame that surrounds them, each of the mage's chubby haunches jostle and sway to the beat of his stride. Filling his garments sometimes beyond capacity, he's frequently seen sporting robes and skirts in a bid to hide his most prominent asset. A fact that often leads to a case of mistaken identity that he loathes so much.{/col}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:90e6ff}================================{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}Though he was born to humble beginnings, the first child of a Westfall family, Dani rarely speaks of his parents or any siblings he may have. Snatched from their fold with only a couple of years to his life, the arcane affinity of the young human outweighed the sentimentality of the newfound parents. Sent off to Dalaran to learn from the scholars of the fabled city, only frequent excursions back to Alliance lands afforded him the chance to keep his connection to the blue and gold alive.\n\nAs he grew Dani felt a tug towards the Alliance. With each passing year it strengthened more and more, until he became insistant that the emptiness his lack of family had left in his heart would be quelled by the warmth of the Alliance banners. Against the wishes of his mentor, Dani departed the floating city and returned to Stormwind, seeking to make a life for himself among the commoners of the city.\n\nWhilst he'd been taught to conjure bread from the sparks of magic in the air, or manipulate light to create almost perfect disguises, social etiquiette was lacking in Herridan's training. The concept of paying rent is new to the upstart sorcerer, and he's suddenly stuck in a city he knows little of, in desperate need of employment.{/col}\n\n",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

She can put anyone to shame when entered in an eating contest. Still the same, she is a lady yet has some sassy ways. \n\nHer passion is to be surrounded by oodles of noodles and covered in flour. She is happiest when in the kitchen creating baked goods and meals to share with others. Sukia is a chef for hire if the job interests her. She adores to travel.\n\nSukia is playful yet she tends to shy away from loud  chaos. Her manner is soft spoken with a giggle that is infectious. Her fluffy paws are groomed to perfection and sometimes she even has nail polish to adorn her claws. Her one paw has a tiny bell woven into her fur. When she walks, a very faint jingle is heard.\n\n\nSukia is never hurtful. She has compassion for people and animals in need and hope for humanity still lives in her heart.

But after four years working different Mercenary jobs,\nHe eventually became a humble, kind and generous man who was quite very loyal to his employers and mercenaries.

He is also a ladies man who has married twice with four children.{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} Lack of Intelligence and cowardness {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Xian was quite the reject when he first came to the Eastern Kingdoms All those years ago.

Some treated the boy with respect while some didn’t.\n\nAt 25 years, Sun was wounded by a Hozan chieftain but was saved by his son Xain who in turn killed the Chieftain with his father's sword. After this, Sun retired from being the Captain and settled down with his son.\nThree months later Jinjing was permitted to leave the household as often as she wanted to support her family.\n\nAt 28 years, Xian convinces his parents to let him go with the other Islanders to visit the world. His father, not trusting outsiders, was hesitant  at first, but agreed,  but his mother protested only to agree when she couldn't convince  Sun otherwise. \n\nWith a Hug from his father and a kiss from his mother he left with the rest of the pandaren for the eastern kingdoms.\n{/p}\n",

In this state she mostly just tries to get up to people and demand affection by barking or just.. sitting there.. as if her brain had melted and the only thing that remained was 5% of her elf self and 5% of her canine self\n\nThings she likes in this form: Being patted, being called a good girl, getting any sort of physical affection, not talking, barking, drooling, being hugged, rubbing up to peopl and getting treats.\n\n\n\n\n\n{/col}{/h3}\n\n",

I say \"was\" because this house is no more.\nI am the last member of my House. And the hunt is nearly all I know this past 16 years. Hunt, war and death.\nMy parents taught me some nobilities and common sense and knowledge. But the most important lessons were to never give up no matter the reason and to trust in my animals.\nIn my family, I had a younger brother. I loved him and played with him as long as we can. Until a disease got him at the age of 7. I was 9 at this moment. We used to play the hunters with our puppies, Bard and Bernie, in the forests, looking for \"trophies\" or \"treasures\".\nI seriously began my training as a hunter when I was 11. Hunting for bigger preys with my father until I was 15 or 16 when I began to hunt by myself. This hunts were meant to prepare myself to become a master hunter, a title only a few can claim and pretend to use our family weapon, Stormbringer.\nAt 18 years old, I could have meet my death when I was hunting a worgen who was suspected for commiting atrocities in the villages close to Gilneas. After a long fight and badly injured, Bard gave his life to let me take the shot against the monster. I was found nearly dead by Bernie two days later and woke up 4 weeks after the incident. With only the scar of my fight as a reminder. My father also told me the worgen was controlled by a witch. But he took care of it while I was recovering.\nDuring the siege of Gilneas by the Forsaken, my father bought us time to escape with my mother out of the city and following the others to the harbor. When I arrived at Darnassus, I offered my help to King Greymane to aid our new allies fighting the war against the Horde. I was 20 at this time.\nSince then, I am now venturing between countries or worlds. Hunting down any beasts, monsters, demons or witches.{/col}",

To help and heal whomever he could with the assistance of the light.\n\nHis glory cut short, as a horde of ghouls seemingly out of nowhere ambushed the camp he was stationed at. While he and his fellow boys in blue fought a valiant fight, it was for nought. They were simply outnumbered and eventually the strength left Jourims body, his last memory being the sound of ghouls gnawing on his limbs and the darkness enveloping him.\n\nThen in a flash, as if he had just woken up from a long hard sleep, Jourim found himself standing in the middle of a frozen lake. His blade stained and rusted, his army issued armor, replaced with colors unfamiliar to him. He could not feel the cold, he could not feel exhaustion. He felt nothing.\n\nNow, with the realisation of his demise, the realisation of the fact that the light will never shine upon him again, Jourim wanders Azaroth, looking for purpose.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-deathknight-cover:256:256}\n",

Though this one, seems very old, noticed only by a different skin chrome.\n \n   If you'd happen to see him without or more revealing clothing, the most of chest, both frontally and backward, sports a multitude of scars, overlapping and crossing in their patterns, some more lenghty than others. Some on the back seems made by lashing, than edges, eventually hinting a timeline of captivity or worse in enemy hands.\n \n   His hands, when exposed, clearly shows the hardenings due to extensive weapon or working tools usage.{/h2}\n\n\n{h1:c}History:{/h1}\n\n\n{link*http://www.argentarchives.org/Shonn*What is publicly known on Shonn Bayerleyn, can be accessed by anyone enterprising a journey to the Halls of the Explorers and Knowledge of Ironforge, where the Argent Archives are.}\n\n\n{link*http://www.argentarchives.org/node/54926*Among his individual feats, Lord Shonn Bayerleyn has been the Champion of the 3rd Edition of the Eastvale Tournament.}\n\n\n{h1:c}Household Information:{/h1}\n\n{link*https://bayerleyn-retinue.enjin.com/recruitment*Link to the Recruitment portion of the webpage.}\n\n{link*http://bayerleyn-retinue.enjin.com*Public information on House of Bayerleyn are accessible at any recruitment office of the Alliance Army in Stormwind and provinces of the Kingdom.

A long scar that ran from below straight down to just above his navel stood out especially, and considering that a mirror-image of it exists on the paladin's back aswell, little was left to the imagination regarding the danger of Desartin's holy duty.\n\nDesartin's face was mostly plain, and lucky for him, the ravages of war have not taken their toll on it. With blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, most who saw him would remember it well, especially when he laughed, something the paladin often did.\n\nShould one meet Desartin in battle, they'd see him in a heavy suit of armor oft worn by Knights of the Alliance. Accompanied by the tabard of the Silver Hand and a large, two-handed hammer made out of solid steel and with holy runes littering the head, there was no mistaking what kind of knight Des is. This was usually complimented by a long, red cloak with gold embroidery. At first sight it was an ordinary cloak, yet the paladin seemed to always wear it whenever he wore the armor. Perhaps someone would find out.\n\n",

He stands at an average - tall height and he is slim and slightly muscular. It is easily noticeable that Ethan doesn't take care of himself at all, it's like his body is protesting against his lifestyle. He doesn't bathe often; he doesn't eat and drink enough; the bags under his eyes are a testament to his amazing sleep schedule. \n\nEthan has an oval face with angular cheekbones and a broad forehead. His deep light-blue eyes sat below his blonde eyebrows that seemed to be perfectly straight near his aquiline nose. He keeps his mouth closed in a thin, straight line, and his bald head reveals his wide forehead. \n\nTwo adjacent scars run over his right eye. A deep-cut scar running from his left ear, across his cheekbone could be easily seen. On his right shoulder, a deep scar could be seen from what used to be a second-degree burn. The scar had been pink years ago, now it was more shiny and pale.\n\nHis personality is reflected by his outward appearance. Ethan always looks angry, like a rough hateful man. To those who look past the hateful man can actually see the broken man which resides inside.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Personality Traits{/h2}{p:c}Ethan often acts as a rough and a hateful man, he scoffs and curses, and most of the time he is stubborn as if he always tries his best to get what he wants. Most know him as a rude man who demands respect even though he doesn't show any in return. Ethan demands control over the situation and he is willing to bicker and fight to get his way. It is clear to many that he is definitely not scared to show his opinion, regardless of the situation. \n\nHis personality was drastically changed due to certain events in his life. At his young age, Ethan used to be a good kid. He was often helpful, kind, and known for his behavior to stimulate others to do the right thing. Sometimes his good intention could turn out bad, but deep down in his heart, he wanted those around him to feel good near him. \nThose who gain his trust can sometimes see his old character return.\n\nOnce his trust is gained in any way, it's best if that person lives up to the trust, as he finds it highly offensive to misplace it, especially when it comes to promises.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}History{/h2}{p:c}[ Please know that this will be rewritten soon. I'm just laying a layout here. ] \n\nAnders Anton, son of Frederik Anton who was High Protector and member of the Order of the Silver Hand. \n\nAnders was born in Andorhal, the distribution center of Northern Lordaeron. His family lived there because his father Frederik was in the army to take care of the Scourge. In the army Frederik saw that the Scourge used horrific methods to spread the plague to turn others into undead. \n\nAnders Anton was born in Northern Lordaeron in a place called Andorhal. His father Frederik heard of a rumor that the village would be attacked by the Scourge. Before they came, Anders and his family fled from Andorhal to the capital city of Lordaeron. The Order saw this as an act of cowardness and treason. But Frederik didn't seem to mind. All he seemed to care about is to protect his family. \n\nThey lived in Lordaeron for a few months before they continued to travel to live behind the great wall of Gilneas. Frederik knew that his family would be safe there. But when they reached the great wall, the Gilneans refused to let them pass because of Frederik's wife, Anders his mother. They didn't seem to understand what why they couldn't go through, well- Anders didn't seem to understand. They continued traveling to Stromgarde where they lived for a few years. \n\nAnders grew up here{/p}",

Small nose, thin lips, sometimes seen with a matt brown lipstick color. The left side of her jawline fitted with two small scars, faded but still visible.\nThe color of skin is a exotic, light caramel variant. Sunkissed, some would say.\n\nShe has a small, lithe but agile looking body. Her shoulders small, arms fitting the size of her body. Shoulder her arms be visible, they'd be seen with scars again, small ones still and equally faded to the ones on her jawline. The palms of her hands equipped with patches of burns, if they're caught visible as well. \nIelia has her feminine traits, though they aint much to brag about. Small chest, flat but toned stomach with a narrow waistline and rear that aint much to talk about, though goes well with her slender legs and small feet. \n\nTypically seen in a faded grey attired, fitted with a belt carrying a few pouches and satchels. Her weapon of choice has its spot on her back on a small leather strap, to keep it in place. The weapon is a long barreled rifle, single barrel. It looks old, but not broken or ready to fall apart. On the back of her satcheled and pouched belt, is a small dagger strapped to it, around her lower back. The handle of the dagger is made out of a dark brown wood, wrapped with some red leather and golden strips.\n \nIelia wears one extra belt, hanging loosely around her waist. It is a bullet belt, with bullets for her rifle. All pristine looking and secured on the belt, with straps made easiily for the huntress to grab a new one to reload.\nBeneath the huntress weapon she wears a small round bagpack, attached to the same leathery strap that holds her rifle.\n",

This was mostly down to the fact that she was hardly ever stressed, and often took time to think about things.\n\nHer mane would be messy in style, not exactly groomed too much, but clean in terms of sanitation, with it being clear that she must shower often to maintain that spotless mane.\n\nMoving onto her other features, her bust would be a quite ample for her size. Kali would be a very bottom heavy gal, with most of her weight being distributed to her thighs, resulting in them being rather formidable, especially at her size as a Worgen. Another effect of this, that would be rather noticeable without the cloak attempting to conceal most of it, would be her massive behind. On any other race, this might not mean much, but on Kali it is very noticable when not concealed, especially in terms of Worgen proportions. {/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff7f00}BACKSTORY{/col}\n\nStarting out as a mage in Gilneas who was interested in science, she soon became obsessed with the idea of advancing science by any means necessary. She started out small, performing experiments within the comforts of her home. Kali soon found that her equipment lacked the precision and accuracy she was looking for, so she decided to go out and look.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the day she was going to leave was the same day the Horde attacked. She ended up getting bitten while trying to defend herself using her fire magic, feeling stranger as time went on. She shrugged it off and made her way to the harbour, having some idle conversations with her fellow survivors who were also boarding the Elven ship.\n\nWhile sailing to Darnassus, she overheard some conversations about mages who perform experiments in Dalaran. She had heard of Dalaran before from the very few scientific articles in the Gilnean times. Kali was sure this was the place she wanted to go, even to the point of spending most of her coin to get there.\n\nThe bite began to take effect as she was travelling, transforming her into a Worgen. Kali was horrified and yet, intrigued at her new appearance. She knew that she had little time to keep her sanity and so she hurried to Dalaran, ignoring any advice that was given to her by the Elves.\n\nKali was just in awe at how effective the city was, struggling to take a few notes in her Worgen form as she arrived. Soon after, she found what she was looking for. A group that was interested in the study of the world using science. They noticed her as a Worgen and said they had developed a cure, independent of the Druids. The cure was surprisingly a success, and they allowed her to join for being such a successful test subject.\n\nShe slowly made her way up through the group, eventually making it as high as head scientist in the biochemical lab. Though, the normal experiments of the group wouldn’t last. They would be thrust into a war against the Legion, where they all took things very seriously.\n\nAll of the group’s efforts were focused on ways to combat the Legion, coming up with various ideas ranging from powerful mana bombs to chemical warfare. They eventually settled on an idea to use feral Worgen to their advantage, a project they dubbed ‘Night Howl’.\n\nThey decided to go to Silverpine forest in their search for ferals, eventually finding a Worgen with a pack of Worgs. This Worgen was sedated and any Worgs killed as they took her back to Dalaran. The group eventually came up with the name ‘Worg Howl’ for their new Worgen, after the Worgs she travelled with previously.\n\nShe was quickly cured in a similar way to Kali. Worg was then taught sign language and then how to read once they were able to communicate with her. Through this reading, she slowly learned common. This wasn’t her main purpose, however, as the group, most notably Kali, began injecting her with all sorts of substances they had developed in an attempt to make her resist any fear and derive pleasure from pain.\n\nThese substances seemed to do the trick as Worg became a literal killing machine, enjoying the bloodbaths she created. They sent Worg out to the front lines during the fight against the Legion, with her killing many demons alongside all sorts of allies.\n\nOnce the Legion was defeated, Worg’s purpose was no longer useful to the group. They decided to let her go free into the forest of Duskwood. Kali wasn’t too happy about that and decided to leave the group before they went into hiding.\n\nNow a lone scientist, Kali must find her own future.{/p}\n\n\n\n\n",

Growing up in the city of Stormwind he had a rather typical upbringing, including playing with the children he went to school with, exploring the park district when he had a moments rest from the schoolwork and misbehaving when all the other kids would get up to no good. He was a normal child, or so he thought..  {/p}\n\n{p:c}It was around the age of ten that his parents started to notice small things that Xantius would unintentionally do, randomly lifting object from tables and shelves or swirling his milk with no spoon. This obviously worried them deeply, especially Xantius' father who did not like the thought of his son being a magic user, he wanted him to take over as his successor at the wheat farms after-all. So they decided to keep it a secret from everyone they knew, including the drunken uncle, who actually didn't notice much of what was going on with being drunk most of the day, Family friends and Xantius' school friends wouldn't find out about his magical tendencies until much later in his life..  {/p}\n\n{p:c}For many years of keeping Xantius indoors and away from others, his mother home schooled him and taught him everything that she knew, this made Xantius' friends think poorly of him when they saw that he had been removed from school so suddenly, thinking that he was sick, some went to even think he was contageous and had to be kept away from others! Rumours though they where, this still upset Xantius greatly. ((insert more about homeschool life)) \nWhen his father returned from his long day at work he would always treat Xantius in a cold and stern way, most likely ashamed of what his son was.\n\n On one night whilst his parents were asleep Xantius snook out of the homestead and went to the park district so that he could feel the air on his skin, reliving moments that he used to have when he was a kid, but on this late night wander he came across a rune enscribed box sat on the park bench, he picked it up and the runes on the outer sides of the box started to glow, he was in awe by this magical trinket, suddenly from behind a tree a large hooded figure stepped out and spoke to him about how the box reacts to magic and explaining to him that he was different from everyone else, how he could unlock his hidden potential by studying the magical arts. This made Xantius eager to learn of magic, which his family was shocked at him for realising his hidden magical abilites. Continuously asking about magic and how he wanted to an apprentice, this infuriated his father so much that he would storm out of the house after shouting at the whole family, one day this was too much for Xantius to handle.. {/p}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-alliance-Knight:256:128}\n{p:c}Three years go by on the homestead and Xantius' dreams of becoming a mage never diminish, He only wishes he could start learning with his family's blessing's, but that will never happen and he knew it. So when nobody was around he would attempt at levitating objects and play with fire from a candle stick, turning it different colours, mere childsplay to a master mage. One day his father came home early and caught Xantius playing with the fire from the candle stick, He went into a frenzy, smashing objects and throwing chairs, Xantius' mother cried and pleaded for him to stop but this only made his father fall into an enraged state. Xantius had finally had enough of it all. With all his fury he made flames from out of nowhere and threw it at his father, burning his face and hair, knocking him unconscious, the flames from the blast setting the curtains on fire and the house began to burn, Stubbornly his mother never leaves the side of his father, and urges Xantius to leave them to their fate. Xantius manages to escape the burning homestead within an inch of his life, coughing and spluttering he looked up to see his home burning to the ground, Xantius vows to never use magic to harm another living person again and to only use it for good, But first he must set out and make a life of his own, a life full of adventure and magic..  {/p}\n\n{h1}{col:ff954d}Becoming of age!{/h1}\n{p:c}Four years go by, traveling, trading and doing the odd favour for the townfolk are just some of the hobbies Xantius has, the biggest hobby being that of practicing magic from scrolls and tomes. He thinks back to the burning of his home sometimes but he always tries to stay positive, even in the darkest hour.  {/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TheInnKeepersDaughter:512:256}\n\n {img:Interface\\Pictures\\11482_crystals_east:256:256}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-mage-cover:256:256}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-14:64:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-88:64:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-MageTowerAlliance:512:256}\n\n\n",

While closer scrutiny reveals the suit to be well-tested in the heat of battle - with small cracks and cuts adding texture to what would've otherwise been perfectly smooth steel - at the most basic glance the figure emanates radiant glory, like a beacon of embodied Light among Azeroth's normalcy.\n\nShould the gem-encrusted helmet come off, it would reveal the stoic face of a Draenei veteran, whose light-blue skin and urgent, solemn visage is peppered by smaller scars. A pair of magnificent, pearl-white sideburns implies age and wisdom, while the bony, symmetrical ridges of his skull plates give him an air of stout determination.\n\nWhat should, realistically, bear the weight of a small horse, seems to be carried with surprising lightness, as the figure strides with snappy, calculated movements and an unburdened swiftness that, while not comparable to a Human scout in leather, certainly seems out of place on a heavily-plated soldier. The segmented nature of the armor plates certainly suggests a higher degree of flexibility, as well, naturally lending itself to combat.\n\nThe Draenei's physique below the armor and leather undergarments is a testament to millenia of strife, as is the case with most Draenei men. His sheer, imposing bulk makes it easy to determine he has swung many a weapon, and spent much of his life in heavy armor. The stately height of his being translates just as well into the width of his muscled limbs, and one would be hard-pressed to find any traces of an lavish lifestyle about him.\n\n{h2:r}{icon:TRADE_ARCHAEOLOGY_DRAENEI_ARTIFACTFRAGMENT:25} Personality, Backstory{/h2}\n\nThese are things best discovered in interaction, not visible at a single glance from his outward appearance.\n\n\n",

Even within the walls of the city, she will opt for wearing robes rather than casual clothing, finding no point in swapping a dress for something almost identical in practice. \n{link*https://missysue.com/2017/10/viking-warrior-halloween-hairstyle/*Hairstyle Reference}",

As her most studied school of magic, it’s her go-to whenever she needs to find a way to solve a problem.\nAbjuration: Should the need arise, Leonie is skilled at pulling forth a shield to protect herself. Protecting her allies is more draining upon her, and so can only be done sparingly.\nNecromancy: Whilst not performing it herself, Leonie has a vague understanding of how necromancy works and is fascinated by all things dead and undead. She quite likes picking apart a necromancer’s methods and finding ways they could have done the job better.\nProfessional: Outside of magical studies, Leonie quite likes doing embroidery, sewing and knitting. She’s not the best at making clothes, but it’s made her quite handy should she need to patch up clothing or give an actual person stitches.

She can’t complain about the upbringing her parents gave her, but with them both being very busy healers in the city she found herself quite often left in the hands of a nanny. This led to Leonie struggling to make actual connections to people she saw as close to her, and prefers bonds where people are kept at an arm’s length away from her heart during her youth.\nThe lack of actual attention from family and a history of healing made Leo naturally curious about anatomy, despite her own magical talents leading her down the path of studying in the Mage District. This curiosity pulled her into a morbid obsession surrounding death and necromancy, and whilst she never dabbled in darker magics herself she could never truly deny the fact it fascinated her.\nCurrently, Leonie continues her studies into magic and her hobby of researching death and anatomy with ghoulish delight. She will never practice necromancy herself, she just likes to learn about it.",

Her love of all things surrounding death and necromancy, however, make her one that the instructors keep a very close eye on. She does NOT practice necromancy, as she understands it is illegal and immoral. It is merely a fascination with learning how it works.\n-Leonie doesn’t have much of a social life at all, her face most likely being an unknown in the city streets despite living there all her life. The Wyther name might be known, however, as both of her parents assist with any major healing work that needs doing within the human territories.",

Measured at a measly 161cm and weighing around 65-odd kilograms, he carries a strangely lean and androgynous form that would see some label him as a woman. Pleasant, light brown hair that seems to flow in smooth lines of finest silk often finds itself tucked in a stylized ponytail to the envy of many. Draping on either side, it frames an angelic face with both young and sharp, androgynous features and slim, devious lips of pale pink. A small nose is flanked by innocent eyes coursing with moonlit silver hues that seem to constantly watch those around him expressively. His elven ears can often be seen twitching, prone to capturing even the slightest of sounds which hints at either natural talent or perhaps military background. Notably, he seems to lack blemishes or any other such imperfection.\n\nA slim and tender neck is flanked by a pair of lean shoulders and and equally small torso whose outlines fall mostly flat. Surprisingly, musculature is present all throughout, pointing towards athleticism and a life of regimented training though strikingly ordinary. It’s the kind you would find on an athletic teenager or woman: unpronounced, it simply exists to replace any accumulated fat, giving him an incredibly nimble and unexpectedly appealing frame; In fact, many describe him as both feline and agile rather than a powerhouse.\n\nMore notably though, his legs are agile and lean, further revealing the permeance of a military background in a former life, odd for someone with such contrasting features. As for his skin, it is a remarkable shade of white, a pale canvas remiss of a snowy day in winter. In fact, its softness and complexion are as ephemeral as snowflakes and equally as striking at first glance.\n\nHe's usually seen, when not expecting an assignment, in a casual outfit built to enhance his innocent qualities. A navy silk shirt that seems a few sizes too big pans down in long sleeves that cover his hands, sleeves which he seems to constantly grip, fingers wrapped around their hem idly. Complementing his shirt is a pair of leather pants, black in coloring, that contrast in how they stick to the shapely for below his waist and tuck neatly into a pair of combat boots with steel-tipped toes.\n\nMost of the time, however, he’s seen wearing something much more conspicuous. A leather attire supplanted with armored plating gives way to tales of the past. Portions of old and battered plated armor, meant for blood knights, protect key portions of his frame and tell tales of a past serving the High Kingdom. Dressed in tones of Scarlet and Black, his military background becomes painfully obvious even if he often chooses to mask his face with an equally black scarf. However, parts of his armor are missing, his attire a mixture of a rogue’s wear and a Blood Knight’s protection, meant to emphasize mobility while compromising as little protection as possible, the cuirass remains, as do the shoulders, though one would be remiss to find any plate at the joins or around the abdomen, instead kept to protect the rib-cage.\n\n{h1:c}Demeanor{/h1}\nAccording to those who know him, Taelyn displays a very meek and reserved attitude. Many equate him to a child who is afraid of the world yet is innocent enough to expect the best from all. He walks around in a coy and self-protective manner but exudes a glimmering shine in his eyes, one of hope. He's quick to make friends with those he doesn't know and quicker to expose what he perceives as the best parts of him to them. Despie talking in an equally soft and meek voice, he's a fairly outgoing boy with a child's heart and a loving, cherished smile. He's often seen biding his time in conversation, almost as if afraid to express himself due to fear of disrupting others.\n\nRecent accounts display a grimmer reality, however. If tales are to be believed, the SI7 agent known as Twilight is another facet of this young man. Those who've seen him and lived to tell the tale describe him as a ruthless, efficient shadow, a ghost who enters as naught but a soft breeze and leaves behind a bloodbath. Many describe his combat style as a dance of blades, one of ruthless precision and cruel intent.\n\nOthers say he's manipulative and enticing, seductive and womanly. A Femme Fatale who seduces men and women alike, manipulating their strings like puppets made to do his bidding and then discarding after their use has been met.\n\n{h1:c}Word of Mouth{/h1}\nNot much is known of Taelyn’s past nor of his present. Many Ren’dorei say that he’s been there since the start, supporting Umbric’s efforts in menial ways such as obtaining information. Despite this, not much is known about him except that he’s always been an odd and reserved person, confiding only in Umbric and his inner circle and only when required. Outside that, he always seemed like a brave and happy young man who saw others as people to befriend and not trouble.",

Snapping at them gets you no where other than destroying your friendship. If you need to talk / vent. Do it. Don't bottle up and lash out.\n\nHaving the mentality of \"I'm mad therefore it's okay to be a jerk\" Is a completely delusional way of thinking. Especially if you can't apologise for being a jerk after acknowledging that you are / have been one. Being stubborn is one thing but how is it so impossible to own up to your mistakes.\n\nWe learn from our mistakes so we have to acknowledge them and move ahead rather than shrug them off and blame someone else.\n\nI'm a fair soul. I give people chance to say sorry or to try and move forward. People make mistakes so it's more than fair to give them a second chance but when you can't even give them a second chance. What the heck do you do.\n\nPeople aren't there to satisfy you and your needs. They aren't there to chase after you and give you attention. They have their own wants and goals so how is it fair to take from them and their happiness just because you're feeling down. Pry eachother up with friendship rather than dragging everyone else down to your pit of depression.\n\n\n{p:c}TLDR: Don't be a dick.\nBeing calm and collected > Being mad and angry{/p}\n",

He would be of fair complexion despite the subtlest hints of aging across his features, his hair and mustache clearly well taken care of showing a slight hint of vanity in the gentleman. His face is also marked by the faintest of scars from his left cheek across his nose to the right cheek, an old wound that has stayed with him for some time while still being faded enough not to take away from his facial features. Dark green eyes stare back at you in a manner either stern or welcoming as they would seem to glimmer in either sunlight or moonlight adding a drawing appeal to them should they catch your attention.\n\nHis body would to say the least be well developed. His strong and broad physique being the result of decades of martial training which would allow him to carry heavy loads such as his armour and any other menial tasks he may come across in his duties. His shoulders would be wide and well formed, adding to the man's particularly wide frame whilst remaining in proportion to the rest of his figure. His arms strong and bulky with muscle would be the most definitive limbs to notice the man's strength as even when wearing clothing they would press at the seams of his attire in a subtle manner to accentuate the kind of musculature that he bore. His chest and abdomen would be toned and firm, showing that he was well trained all over rather than simply one or two parts of him. Thickly developed pectorals and a well structured six pack being the main giveaway to such toning. Finally his backside and legs would be firm and powerful respectively, his thighs while having just a healthy enough bit of fat on them would be just as strong as the rest of him, evident in his more than often striding form as he goes by life step by step.\n\nScarred by many a mark of battle it would be safe to call the man a canvas of war. From the smallest slash marks to the faint remains of the grizzliest gashes over his body it would show that war has been a rather cruel mistress to the soldier. The most notable old wounds the man would carry are in the forms of six criss-crossing lash marks over his back from a whip along with many other faded ones. What would appear to be the remains of a spider's jab mark on the far left hand side of his chest and the remnants of a deep burn on his right hip. Most recently he would have been graced with a deep bite from several deep canines on his right shoulder. Something that has recently come to play a particularly large role in his life.\n\nThe attire the man often wears would vary by his duty. More often than not he is found clad in his armour, thick heavy plate that would clunk everso gently with each striding step taken. He would look the ideal soldier in such armour as he carries himself with both distinction and humility, showing to those he passes that he is worthy of nothing more than trust. When not in his armour however he takes to more refined clothing often in the form of garbs he would don as a steward, trying to keep himself as presentable as possible to all those he engages. His clothing tending to cling to him given his large form would be rather suited to accentuating his muscular body in a manner that he is either unaware of or that he pays no mind to.\n\nWith recent events so suddenly being placed upon the man he would find himself with a new form should he choose to take it. The man would have succumbed to the worgen curse and therefore would be able to change his shape at will. His worgen form stands at the height of 8'3 (253cm), allowing him to tower over most humans. The new coat of fur he would bare would resemble his own hair in his human form in that it would appear to be rather well groomed if a little bit on the fluffy side. Something the man has since come to embrace since his transformation. His ears would be cut short and his muzzle baring the same scar running over his nose. While he would do his best to keep himself approachable it couldn't be denied that his fangs were a little bit on the intimidating side, much as he would try to keep them concealed or at least not go baring them with every word or chuckle he would give.\n\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ipUBRS75pw*Music of the day!}{/h3}",

Her brother was slightly younger than she was, making Yuki the protective older sister to her kind hearted and gentle sibling. Her life quickly spiraled from content to tragic as her brother was killed late at night in their family home. The months went by and the guards dropped the case, not being able to find any clues or leads for the case, however Yuki would not give up so easily. Bring frustrated with the guard, she stole their evidence book, and begand investigations of her own. Many years down the line, she had yet to give up hope, seeing perspectives of the case the guards had failed to and getting ever closer to finding out who had murdered him in cold blood, and for what reason. Eventually though, the leads ran dry, and just as Yuki was on the verge of discovery her progress was unrewarded, and her evidence was made null. Frustratedly, Yuki turned to a darker method of finding out the killer, by seeking arcane powers that would allow her to look back in time and connect her frayed leads. Mention of Shadow and Void study had been mentioned around Silvermoon, and Yuki was interested. Finding out that the Void harnessed so much potential power, she had to have that power for herself. Perhaps it could grant her the power of time vision she so desired. Buying the materials from back alley markets, and setting up the ritual, she was sure of herself that she would gain powers beyond her control. Alas, the ritual backfired and her body and mind were scattered through the Void. Her saviour being a Knowledgeable and wise Elf, saved her from the Void and stabilised her being. The cost of her error, being transformed into a Ren'dorei and her memory being lost to the void. Yuki now not having a purpose, she joined the Stormwind army Ranger division using her tracker skills, and fighting in the fourth war. N'Zoths corruption threatened the world, allowing glimpses of the bleak future ahead. Yuki saw this is an oppurtunity to look back in time once more and reclaim her vision. Using the help of the Wise Mage once more, and his companion, they completed the final vision. A flood of memories entered her mind, unable to tell if they were even hers or not, but when they had finally stopped, she knew that they were hers. Being whole again, and with her Ren'dorei powers, Yuki now has a new purpose, one that she had forgotten about many years ago. To find the person who had killed her brother, and to put an arrow between his eyes.",

The rest of her ruby red was likey left around his croutch. She's accepted her new role, and has been his devouted crotch-sniffing cocksucker ever since.\n\nLevanna: This one gets mad with him a lot. That doesn't stop him from fucking her silly on a regular basis. You're more likely to see her groping herself while she sucks his cock then fighting for the Alliance, these days.\n\nGwaenlen/Celywien: A kind priestess introduced him to lusty Horde traitor, who left lots for ruby red smeared over his dirty old dick.\n\nMelorilla: A mouthy fuckgoat that got what was coming to her. If you hurry, you might catch her laying utterly defeated in a cum puddle out behind the blacksmtih.\n\nVinajah: One whiff of his manly aroma had this massive, muscled bound vindicator strangling herself on his cock and her cunt violently seeded.\n\nManorsa/Athenril: With a little help from a chemical he stole from some goblins, he raped this curvy druidess into his breeding bitch.\n\nTarleficia: Had this redhead take a look at some 'swelling' I have been experiencing. Over the festival music, no one heard her screaming out like a little whore from her experiencing my 'swelling' as well.\n\nAlexia Barov: A youthful Shadowblade, this one had heard rumor of him and can not seem to focus on her duty to the Alliance when he shows. His dirty old dick has her hooked, unfortunately.\n\nTaali - An elf who was unfamiliar with what is customary among humans, he was more than happy to fill her in. She now apologizes by sucking cock until it paints her face and tits. Still, she has much to learn.\n\nAmina - The elfie was the type of hero people would write stories about for years to come. Was. If you see her without him these days, she's probably in a ditch somewhere, covered in jizz, eyes crossed with her tongue hanging out.\n\nEshlaniel - The elf was doing a public service, having herself be ravaged by him so he wasn't free to degrade some other innocent maiden. One elongated encounter with him later, and she sports a band around her ring finger, marking her as his wife and claimed fuck puppet. You might catch their offspring scampering around any day now.\n\nMirenth - What a wimp this one was. This fat-assed elf tried to tell him off, even slapping him once before finally realizing the old bastard's superiority. Now? You can catch them oinking and sucking his cock as Daddy's owned piggy.
