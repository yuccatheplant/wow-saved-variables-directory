As such, she trained twice as hard when duty called for her - and it showed. \n\nClad in light-weight, magically infused plate armor, she carried herself with a sense of purpose. Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

Came to Azeroth along with other orcs back during First war. Because of a certain incident, before Orgrim Doomhammer's rise to power, he fled the Horde to live as a Hermit travelling across Azeroth. Rejoined the Horde during the founding of Orgrimmar after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits.\n\nConsidered more gentle and cosiderate than most orcs, Still values Honor and strenght. His wolf is always somewhere nearby.\nWidower with sons all over the place.\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nKoruz became part of the leadership of Darkheart company. Nearing the end of the last campaign he died attempting to save his friends. Recently came back after journeying through Shadowlands.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2}{icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is an Older orc, a fact that isnt reflected in his appearance, betrayed only by the silver color of his hair. said hair is lenghty, tied into various braids, and a ponytail to ensure it won't be a problem in combat. his beard is also quite long, and braided aswell. His physique is quite impressive on it's own, even for an orc, without even mentioning his age, leaving the wonder of how he looked when he was younger. various scars adorn his body, left by anything starting from beasts, through enemy warriors, and otherwordly creatures. his body is also adorned in tatoo's, which on first glance look like typical Burning blade marks, but in fact serve as runes, that are able to protect Koruz from harmfull magical effects of magics, with void and light magic remaining exception, which although still slightly protected from, remains quite vulnerable to. his expressions tend to be a bit dimmed down, remaining mostly calm in all situations.\n\n{h2:c}Equipment{/h2}{icon:spell_warrior_sharpenblade:25}\n\nKoruz's equipment is mostly simply, resembling a typical blademaster's attire. fine quality leather gloves with bronze vembraces, long kilt woven from strong thread with few steel plates attached, and a double belt with sacks attached to hold it up. Padded leather belts crossing on his chest and tied around his biceps for a bit of extra protection, but mainly because of the pouches on said belts for exttra carry space. otherwise he wears no chestplate as to not limit his movements, spare cloth bandages covering parts of his chest and arms, for unknown reasons. His boots are also made from strong leather, with steel tips and few spikes. His most prized possesion is his blade, that to many remains mystery. Most often his blade look quite simplistic, it's long and slick, but still tough and sturdy. It widens at the end with a ring being attached at the end containing various trophies and trinkets. what is unusual about it is it's blue glow, and slightly colder and spiritual aura.\nAfter coming back from his unfortunate journey through shadowlands, his blade now shifts between that and the other apperance. That other appearance looks like a runeblade, similarly built to the other one, with it's tip resembling a guillotine. adorned with various runes, and a skull with dark steel plates. the blade emanates a sickly green aura that seeps around like a miasma. Those who look upon that blade tend to feel unnatural fear, and those of stronger spirit feel discomfort.\n",

Being struck by lightning forced her parents to bargain with any listening spirits, unfortunately for Senko, that spirit was malevolent. Restored to life, under a Felbound contract, Senko spent her childhood adapting with burnt eyes and a fried chest. Once she turned 10, she was handed over to the spirit. {/p}\n{p}Determined not to be enslaved by a foul entity, she refused the ways of Fel. For 5 years she was punished for her defiance, which ended in her being sold into slavery to the Faithless. The Fel had already latched into her, burning up inside and making her prone to irrational decisions and black-outs. Her moment of freedom happened when she turned 'feral' and began ripping chunks of a Sethrakk out with her claws and teeth. In this bloodlusted state, her blood-stained muzzle and manical howls broke the morale of the Sethrakk, allowing her to escape.{/p}\n{p}For 5 weeks, she roamed the dunes, barely surviving. Little water, and less food, the Fel within her began to consume. Enter the Horde. A Troll Shaman had been sent to Vol'dun to investigate royal suspicions when he saw the dying Vulpera. Having already helped several, he stopped and aided Senko, quickly noticing the Fel fire gushing out of surface wounds. He taught her his Shamanistic ways of controlling fire, enabling her to at least keep the raging fires of Fel away.{/p}\n\n{link*https://www.flipsnack.com/felskitchen/fel-s-kitchen-menu.html*Fel's Kitchen Menu}",

Animated, easygoing and mercurial of temperament, this Forsaken woman does not seem to be allowing a little thing like death get between her and a good time. At least, that is what she would like to put forward; as time passes and undeath swallows her more and more the more her goodnatured persona slips more frequently, seeming like a hollow caricature. An act, whether of deliberate subterfuge or merely fear of losing herself? Simply the trauma of her fate getting to her? Hard to tell, it is unlikely even she knows herself. \n\nShe has a lot of time for people, personable and (she would call herself) quick-witted, and more than willing to hear all ends of a discussion. Once upon a time she might have been more hot-tempered and confrontational, but her experiences have leant her a measured patience which more often than not is lost behind the persona. When she is working said persona tends to fade away, leaving her quieter and more focused.\n\n{h2}Appearance{/h2}\n\nShrouded in garments which conceal a great deal of her form, it's clear Renlie is not the pinnacle of high fashion. Most of her gear is old Kul Tiran sailing leathers scavenged or bartered from where she can get them; reminders for her old homeland. Though any who suspect she may harbour allegience to her island home need only look to the Kul Tiran insignia upon her right shoulder; the design has been deeply and deliberately cleft across, letting its symbolism speak for itself.\n\nShe has been fortunate enough to be fairly well-preserved; She has been known to joke that all the time spent at sea has salted her meat too much for it to go off easily. Her gaze is sharp and has a habit of roaming around in restless watchfulness. Her movements are broad and somewhat affectatious, save for when it becomes time to work.\n",

Before The Horde arrived in Vol'Dun she traveled with the caravan trading and scavenging with exiles and pirates. It was at this time she developed her skill as a raptor rider as well as learning to defend herself and her kin. She became well adapted to survive in the desert, with skills in navigating the harsh desert as well as the herblore to properly take advantage of  Vol'Dun's sparse flora. \n\n{h1}{icon:battleground_strongbox_skirmish_horde:18} Arrival of the Horde{/h1}\nWhen the Warchief arrived in Zandalar, the Horde offered aid and more importantly work. Her caravan could effectivley navigate the desert, becoming a part of the Horde supply chain in Vol'Dun. Things seemed as if they were starting to improve, with steady work and new allies in the desert.\n\n{h1}{icon:spell_fire_incinerate:25} The Alliance 7th Legion{/h1}\nWhile running supplies across the desert Inkieh's caravan was ambushed by The Alliance 7th Legion ambushed. They brought monstrous weapons of war unlike anything she had ever seen. They destroyed her caravan and wiped out her kinsfolk. Those that weren't torched with the caravans fled into the desert, where the elements and starvation began to take their toll.\n\n{h1}{icon:ability_racial_returntocamp:18}Scattered Survivors{/h1}\nAfter three days in the desert she and her companion, Zeepah, were the only two left alive. They eventually found salvation with a group of Horde soldiers stranded in the desert.\nThe pair were brought back to a Horde camp where they were finally given some respite from the extreme temperatures of the desert. Wanting to do their part they volunteered to aid in the rescue of a Horde Commander, and a Deathlord of the Ebon Blade taken captive by The Sethrak.\n\n{h1}{icon:achievement_boss_lichking:18}A Debt to be Paid{/h1}\nIn the frantic rescue the injured caravan guard sacrificed herself to save her companions and fell to The Sethrak. She was surrounded in darkness, it seemed like only fear and oblivion awaited her. \nSomething seemed to latch onto her spirit however, and hooked in her neck to tow her back to the realm of the living. Zeepah, having managed to rescue The Ebon Blade Deathlord pleaded for any way to help her passed friend. She would be brought back to the realm of the living, but would now serve The Ebon Blade.",

Honed over several years of ferocious conflict, she stands tall, proud, and strong in the face of adversity. Like those she fights with on the frontlines her body is covered in rugged, powerful muscle and heavy scarring. Her eyes are potently charged with mana, Shalassian and Orcish Military tattoos radiating arcane fury and rarely extinguishing. Together they crackle potent azure magic at her fingertips with a mere moment's notice. It is a sharp disparity to her dark skin, coloured so that you could lose her in the shadows of twilight.\n\nWhile lighter on her blush than many of her fellow Suramarians, Velravyn always keeps herself made up with mascara and foundation. Her clothing has become far more practical than her homeland; when not in her armour, she can often be seen in high-neck shirts, thick cloth pants and calf-length leather riding boots. This exposes her incredible collection of scars, from face to feet, including a trio of wicked marks over her right eye and a stark circular ring about her left forearm. Her back is by far the worst, a horrific torturer's canvas of white and black lines twisted into stiff valleys of scars.\n\nHer hair is kept clean and bound in a cloth-wrapped ponytail and braids, the loose ends either tucked beneath a rugged old hat or a bandanna to ensconce her ears, both of which are missing their upper halves. Like her hair, her nails are often kept just so; manicured and lacquered when on vacation and just barely kept in the thick of combat.\n",

While she frequents usual pleasantries with light smiles and a keen eye, often she keeps her inner thoughts restrained with a placid masque-like face. Her voice, {link*https://youtu.be/WomoIywubm4?t=349*worn hoarse through the din of battle, is a low and appeasing contralto} clearly crafted in its cadence for the polticial battlefied of the Court of Stars.\n\nHer sharp eyes belay a keen cunning and intelligence, transmitted often through creative sarcasm or warm humour. She has a natural Suramarian confidence to her attitude and body, though seems for the most part to keep her pride in check. She often affixes her sentences with polite titelage, using, 'My dear,' to those within her circle and addressing others by rank or last name.\n\nTo those who know her well she is a friendly, warm face who will give all she can. To her enemies, however, she is known as a terrible and brutal opponent, a cruel imagination sparking behind those ever-thinking eyes.",

Here and there, her armour is accented with elements of Suramarian military flaire.\n\nBuilding her own armour piece by piece, the Nightborne wears a light Orcish warharness over her stark blue tattoos. During campaigns, a strong plate neckguard is added to her ensemble for a little extra protection. Standing out amidst her sleeker is a heavy pauldron bearing the skull of a felled Proto Drake. Mounted upon her back is her Sashimono – {link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/232649*a warbanner bearing the sigil of the Crowblade.} The sigil depicts a bird poised for combat with the recognisable Burning Blade held in its beak. A delicate shal’dorei transmutation rune encircles the bird and its weapon. Atop the ironwood banner, bound with red cloth, sits a trio of dark trophies. A gilded Demonic Inquisitor's skull is nestled into the apex, a crudely carved Imp-skull hanging just below it by a similar sash while a third rests below of a much larger, similarily horned creature. All have arcane permanance runes engraved into their brows, preventing them from returning to the Nether.\n\nThe rest of her armour is comprised of light, layered drake-plates. Borne over one shoulder is the skull of a felled Proto-Drake, it's plates matching those of her taloned boot-guards and the ornate taloned gauntlet strapped over an arm. Her legs are armoured with a dragonscale kilt hanging from a bulky warbelt. The unearthly white shimmer across the dead ebony scales indicate they once belonged to an Infinite Dragon. Shimmering arcane feathers poke out from underneath their leather thighguards, giving the high-sitting leg armour more of a flared, slimming effect. These scales are held up by a sturdy belt that is bedecked with pouches and a handy first aid kit. \n\nOn her hip, bound by a blue Shalassian Silk sash, {link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/246413*the ancient Elunite steel blade, “Anaris,” sits within a crow-feather sheath.} The Orcish symbol for 'Fire,' is painted over the metal finishing connecting the feathers to the mouth of the scabbard, an ornate rope sword-frog holding the sheath to the sash. Draped over the metal mouth is a rope tassle, bearing a twilight blue bead, a perfect pearl, and a third gem of the two melded together in a perfect eclipsing moon. A jade bead hangs from the tassle itself, the maker's mark supporting the rest of the blade. Any familiar with Azshara’s Expansion Wars against the Troll Empire would recognise it and its elven details such as the crescent moon pommel, and the Qiraji Obsidian eclipsing guard. Those with a keen eye would recognise its forging origins as both ancient Mogu and Pandaren, the latter clear in the blade's form and the Cloud-serpent styled metal collar just below the guard.\nTo the Zandalari Empire and Trolls of old, it is a wretched blade rumoured to sever a troll’s connection to their Loa.",

He maintains a precise, fashionable apperance. His weatherbeaten face is well groomed, with sharp facial hair kept precise and in line.\n\nAt his hip hangs a ceremonial Naval sabre. It is gilded, but marked with deep gouges from years of use. Of everything he caries, it is always polished and as tidy as it can be.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-Freehold:256:128}\n\n{h1:c}Background and Public Knowledge{/h1}\n\nRafaiel's military career spanned three centuries with the old Thalassian Fleet. As a High Elven captain of some renown, Rafaiel worked to maintain the shipping lanes between Qel'thalas and Kul Tiras. He enjoyed the rank of Captain for many years, and his experience of the waters in those areas is second to none.\n\nIn the years following the Fall, Rafaiel has earned himself a name as a fairly successful businessman, shipping goods from across the known world.\n\n\n{h3}{col:8190ff}\"To Absent Friends\"{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h1:c}Art{/h1}\n\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711953922654227/RafShipZiry.png?width=1156&height=676*Rafaiel working by Marcerian}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811960563386810368/811972946616647680/Tattoo_for_Rafaiel.png*Tattoo Reference by WolfjeLina}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812712072344240188/unknown.png?width=1373&height=676*Rafaiel at work - zoomed}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711838952325140/Raf_Marcerian_sketch.png?width=478&height=676*Rafaiel face sketch by Marcerian}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711888823386112/Captain-Raf-Birthday_2020-1.png?width=380&height=676*Stormy Weather by WolfjeLina}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711864365744158/RafRender.png?width=380&height=676*Rafaiel rendered by WolfjeLina}\n",

A fancy dagger is fastened to the tip and functions as a bayonet.\n\n{icon:garrison_greenarmor:30}\n{h2}Gear{/h2}\n\nMost of the time, Pekun wears sturdy plate armor.

Should one catch him without his armour though, one would find several stab- and shot wounds marring his torso and legs.\n\nPekun's ear-cuff is concealing a sizable hole where a chunk is missing from his right ear. This is obviously the only scar he is actively trying to hide.\n\n\nHis armor is usually kept in good shape. The unobtrusive necklace, sporting several large teeth and claws, that dangles around the Goblin's neck, as well as his single nose piercing, are the only jewellery he wears (aside from his ear-cuff).\n\n---\n{icon:ability_racial_bestdealsanywhere:30}\n{h2}Personality & Quirks{/h2}\n\nPekun tends to call people descriptive nicknames instead of using their actual ones.\n\nHaving spent most of his days as a neutral merc, he doesn't have a lot of faction pride for the Horde. But he's fiercely loyal to his friends and will go through hell and high water to defend them; be it against physical harm or merely verbal offences.\n\nLike many goblins, what Pekun lacks in physical size and strength, he makes up for with his ingenuity. Which is why his spear is modified to increase it's effectiveness especially against larger targets. He loves to tinker, especially when faced with a problem that needs to be overcome. One of the results of this are his patented one-time-use rocket-propelled mail-chickens.\n\n---\n{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled03:30}\n{h2}History{/h2}\nAsk ic ;)\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Wetlands:256:128}",

He strives to paint himself with the brush of polite kindness, rather than the bristles of arrogance and ignorance. Such, in his eyes, would make him no different to those who blocked his path for most of his life.\n\nPristine composure was evident in the ways of the mage's appearance, warm with tones of beige and orange and the lightest shades of cream and white. Fashion, nor style, was ever his forte, but yet he found himself often in clothing seldom frequented by the rest of his elven kin - attires that caught the eye, stylistically, but never struck out to be in poor taste. The most common of such ensembles was a thin brown shawl covering parts of a cream cravat, layered neatly with silk and cotton underlayers that sought to keep him comfortable in any fling of weather.\n\nBeloril's youth was ultimately relevant within the etchings of his skin and face; cheekbones defined yet holding the slightest springy curves that cushion his well-formed, sparkling smile. It was not long ago that he attained the gleaming, golden tint to his almond eyes, yet through the constant practice of ember-based magics they could easily be regarded as effervescent at the least - slivers of the Sunwell's light pooled in with something far warmer, of which reflected against the strawberry curls of his eyelashes.\n\nPerhaps his most notable, distinguishing feature, was the bouncing and flowing curves of his light hair - noticeably and unmistakably woven with the warmth of orange and pink, to create a shade that was neither fully ginger nor fully blond. Even so, his cheeks were tainted with the sight of freckles that so often accompanied those with red locks; dotting skittishly across his smooth nose and fanning out over a pair of long, thin ears, and barely missing the circumference of his well proportioned lips.{/col}",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

When in the company of females he can be quite a flirt, but always seems to know when to draw the line and stop. He enjoys meeting new people and isn't afraid to start conversation. \n\nRespect is a big thing for Veldar, he will show respect to people with titles but he won't try to hide how he speaks, conitnuing to talk to them like they were anybody else. He will not stand back and let someone speak down to his friends.\n\nPhysical Form:\n\nFor years Veldar has worked as a Mercenary, through which he has went through tense strict training which has helped to keep his body in top shape. If one were to see him without his shirt they might notice some scars across his form from the many fights he has been in over the years. After the discovery of Pandaria though he was conviced to follow a new path, and has thus begun training as a monk which has only helped to develop his body more and help his muscle pop.\n\nAppearance:\n\nVeldar likes to change his image occassionally. Sometimes he can be spotted wearing dark leathers while others more comfortable wear for lounging around in.\n\nWhen attending more formal occassions he has formal wear that he can wear but he tends to feel uncomfortable in them.\n\nFor anyone who has known Veldar for long one thing that hasn't changed or seem like it will ever change is his hair. Always spiked up and never seeming to flatten.\n\nEquipment:\n\nFor most of his life Veldar has always been intruiged by engineering and has taken it up as a hobby. Through which he has incorparated various gadgets into his armour while also keeping small tools on his body.\n\nWhen he is in his armour he would have two daggers on him. These two daggers kept in peak condition and seem to have some sentimental value to him as he hates to see anyone else with them. Under his cloak he has taken to carrying two Erimsca Sticks, quite deadly weapons on there own but have been modified so that they can be attatched together to form into a Bo Staff.\n\n\n\n\n",

Trautfizzle{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-TheMotherlode:256:256}\n{h2:c}Profile By Skinkzey Nutwrencher{/h2}\n{h3:c}(Sponsored and edited by Jastor Trautfizzle){/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}Appearance{/h1}\n\nJastor Trautfizzle has changed over the years. His eyes were once red, his body lean and athletic from spending hours at work in his doctors surgery, and after a time where his eyes were green and his body less than athletic, it seems that life with the Bilgewater Battalion has given him muscle to match his bulk and he's even made consciencous effort to draw away from corruption. Aside from his eyes, his head seems to have taken the brunt of the toll which comes from dabbling in the fel, his face being more wrinkled and what was once a full head of hair having fled the top of his head, forming into sideburns which he struggles to keep in check. \n\nHowever, concerning his fashion sense <The next part seems to have been edited heavily> Jastor is a pioneer in good fashion sense, from his black battle ensemble with felforge ventilation to the finery which he wears when interacting with other important people, or attending fanciful functions, the problems brought about by AGING seem to slip away thanks to the Doctors impeccable style choices.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WorkshopHorde:512:256}\n\nI come from humble beginnings. Back on Kezan I lead the simple life of a Doctor after I graduated from Crapopolis U. I lived in Bilgewater Port out of my very own surgery with my family, who I unfortunately had to sell to the insurance company so that I could get tickets aboard Gallywixes Pleasure Yacht because Mount Kajaro went and blew its top whilst I was operating.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-LostIsles:512:256}\n\nHere's a holiday snap I took of the Lost Isles, ok so it was more of a traumatizing shipwreck in which I was attacked by wild animals, almost zombified by pygmies and temporarily enslaved by the Trade Prince but I got to say, the island was beautful. Until it got melted by another volcano...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n\nFor a while after the Lost Isles fiasco, I decided following the Trade Prince who had just enslaved me a week or so ago wasn't really for me. So I ran away with the Darkmoon Faire and learnt myself some warlockery. At first it was just an act, pull the imp out of a tophat, saw a voidwalker in two, but then it became something else, it became a -passion-.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Azshara:512:256}\n\nI've ended up saddled with the Bilgewater Cartel, again. It turns out that carnies don't take kindly to my response to their FALSE accusations being to give them the old finger and fly off in their dirigible. Of course they didn't really expect a guy who was once a fully qualified doctor (I still am by the way), to roll up dressed as a mad scientist. So they assigned me somewhere, let's just say my time in Azshara was short lived as it turns out 'they don't want their lumber turned into charcoal', ingrates...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Felwood:512:256}\n\nWhere did I end up? Felwood of course, where else would a Goblin warlock of my talents end up but in the back end of nowhere surrounded by the remnants of a once great empire of treehuggers and hippies, hidden away from the rest of the world to do my work.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-FelForge:256:128}\n\nBut don't you worry, ladies and gentlemen, the good old doctor still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and in this little pocket of fel infested paradise, my final trick is already in the making...",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

Otherwise there are few signs of age on him, nor are there any battle scars.\n\nHis green eyes regard his surroundings with a cold, calculating stare. An interesting effect to this is how it translates to his expressions. Whichever emotion he conveys, joy, anger, sadness, is never visible in his eyes aswell, sometimes making his expressions rather eerie.\n\nHair: His long, well-combed and kept hair is of a faded grey colour, as is his beard.

This dream however, came into conflict with her personal values. Teya felt that Garrosh Hellscream was too barbaric, and after hearing the horrific events of the bombing of Theramore, she felt she was at odds with the Horde, and after a battle with an unruly Garrosh apologist, Teya left her home in Orgrimmar.\n\nTeya's life became very nomadic, exploring all the corners of the isle of Kalimdor, training against whoever offered a duel. Her life became solely focused on her training, rarely taking reprieve in the beautiful scenery, hearing the tyranny of Garrosh occasionally from the citizens of the towns she passed through, fuelling her rage, and increasing the harshness of her self imposed training.\n\nReturning to Orgrimmar months later to the mistreatment of Trolls and the slavery of Tauren, Teya looked for any signs of resistance against the Orcish supremacy regime, and found plenty of it. Joining ranks with the likes of Lorthemar Theron and Vol'jin, as well as the Alliance in the siege of Orgrimmar, Teya fought against the Iron Juggernaut, and after a long battle, met her death against the might of the great machine.\n\nAfter dying to the Iron Juggernaut, Teya found herself alive once more, at her grave. Lost for words, being greeted by an undead General Nazgrim, offering Teya another chance at life as a knight of the Ebon Blade. Teya accepted and swore fealty to the Lich King, grateful for her one more shot at life, after it was cruelly taken away by the Orcish Horde. ",

					["TX"] = "\nVoice Ref: Michael Wincott (Death, Darksiders 2)\n\nKylarias was born into the lesser known House Hirorithal, notable for their long years of service within the Farstriders ranger corp, Kylarias followed the footsteps of his father and mother, joining the order. For years, he protected the Kingdom of Quel'thalas, thwarting any attempts on its borders from Amani raiders. He participated in the Second War, defending his home from Horde invaders. It was here that he gained the bulk of his accomodations and feats, outshining his peers in his effectiveness in battle, becoming a decorated member of the Farstrider order. As the Horde suddenly pulled back without notice, he joined the Alliance of Lordaeron and chased them down, finally putting an end to the Horde's reign of terror in the Eastern Kingdoms.\n\nOver the years after the second war, Kylarias travelled with members of the Alliance, mopping up any Horde presense left in the land, sending the survivors to internment camps where they would be contained, eventually becoming a foot note in history. The Quel'dorei then returned home, taking up his old role in securing their borders from the dregs of Amani still left after the war.\n\nPeace, of course, did not last long. The Scourge, during their seemingly unending expansion within the Eastern Kingdoms, arrived on the door step of Quel'thalas. While their true goal was unknown, he joined arms with the Farstriders in what would be the final time. Despite the best efforts of all Quel'dorei from ever walks of life, the source of their long lives and very beings was sacrificed to raise a powerful mage in the form of a Lich. Their King dead, lands in ruins, Kylarias lost friends and family during and with the aftermath of the attack.\n\nPrince Kael'thas Sunstrider rose up, putting hope back onto the table. When the call for volunteers was put out for people to venture into unknown lands to find a cure for the ailments of the now Sin'dorei, Kylarias would have been amongst the first to pledge his sword to the cause. He left his children behind with his brother, travelling with his partner in hopes of finding a better life.\n\nShortly after, Kael'thas allied himself with Illidan Stormrage, an unknown figure that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. This Demon Hunter was able to cure the Elves' magic sickness, introducing the Fel. The Hunter also offered to train the Sin'dorei in his ways. The Prince sent Sin'dorei off with the Kaldorei to their fates. Kylarias and his partner were one of many.\n\nHe trained at the Black Temple, going through his trials, little by little, the Elf he once saw himself as was crumbling with each passing day. When he was considered ready for the ritual of binding, Kylarias felt ready, but also fearful of what was to come. A Wrathguard appeared. Armed with only his will, he fought like it was his last battle. He just barely brought the demon down, only having enough strength to consume the demon's heart. Like many of his peers, after consuming the flesh and witnessing the demon's memories, he was subjected to madness. He clawed out his eyes in desperation, but he did not stop there. He had to be stopped from doing further damage, almost completely ripping his head apart. The newfound strength building up and the absolute fear he felt almost killed him. He awoke in the temple, his sight gone, but replaced with something else. He chose to wear a mask to cover up his twisted visage, keeping it a secret and only revealing it to those he trusted.\n\nAfter finishing his training and rites, he joined his newfound Illidari bretheren in taking the fight straight to the Legion. They fought from one charred world to the next, sending demon after demon back to the Nether. Side by side with his partner, they sent back tens of demons for every life lost during the attack on their homeland. Their battles were short lived, however. The battle-sister of the demon Kylarias consumed had tracked him down, singling him out in the chaos of one attack on a Legion world. The Shivarra drove the two away from the heat of battle, capturing Kylarias' love. The demon toyed with her, inflicting as much pain onto her as Kylarias did to her love. When Kylarias managed to track down the two, it was too late. His love was too far gone to save. It was at this point Kylarias lost the only the thing keeping him attached to his people, discarding the feelings of, as he put it, mortals, vowing to remove every demonic trace from the cosmos.\n\nHe fought in Mardum during the penultimate invasion, returning to find his master dead. The Wardens who dedicated their lives to tracking down the betrayer quickly turned the Illidaris' powers against them, locking them in Fel crystals and burying them deep in the vaults, ensuring that the Illidari would not fufill their destinies or carry out their objective of the Legion's complete fall.\n\nThe years after this were lucid, often remembering slight sights. The dank, dark room he was placed, the silence. Fleeting moments of his past flashed in his mind, reminding of him what was and what he had lost. As the years went on, the Illidari almost lost whatever hope he had left of breaking free from his prison, content with remaining in suspended animation for eternity.\n\nWith the Legion gaining another way into Azeroth by way of Gul'dan, the warlock of a far flung version of Draenor that had somehow made his way to Azerothian soil, the Wardens were left with little choice, breaking the Illidari free to combat the Legion. Kylarias used this opportunity to rip the demons apart, fighting across the Broken Isles, popping the bubble of Suramar, fighting his way on the Broken Shore to drive his glaives deep into the Tomb of the Dark Titan. He fought on Argus, taking the fight to the Legion and aided in any way he could to end the rule of Sargeras forever.\n\nThe Fourth War brought with it a lot of contension. He was Illidari, the wars that the denizens of the world got themselves were of insignifcance compared to the grander scale, but he also felt bound to the Sin'dorei. The very people that he first left the confines of home to ensure that their legacy lived on. With this, he decided to dip his toe into it, never truly declaring his alliegence to the Horde or the Alliance, but stepping in the methods used went too far.\n\nWith the revelation of the Banshee's true motives, the end of the war and the instantanious rise of the Black Empire, he lent a hand in the peacekeeping operations and routing out of Old God influence within the Horde's borders. It was with the end of the war that he got into touch with his fellow Illidari, banding together with them once again to effectively and directly enact Illidan's will.\n\n(WIP)",

He's very optimistic (sometimes a little bit too much) and enthusiastic in the things he does.\nHe isn't neccesarily smart, but he does have a decent level of intellect. It is just not always shown in the ways other may find obvious.\n\nHe doesn't really judge others. He thinks everything that happens, happens for a reason, and that there's no such thing as a bad, or a good person.\n\nWhen he does get sad or angry, it is for the right reasons. Most of those situations involve people he cares about getting hurt. There's nothing more important to him than his friends and allies.\n\n\n",

This patch resembles a texture similar to that of a brush. The hair is fine, yet rough at the same time.\n\nThough this young Vulpera is mostly unscathed of the markings of war, the occasional scar can be found scattered across his form. The most noticeable marking, whilst not outstanding by any means, is the scar on his left brow. More often than not, this fox has traces of sand dotted around his fur as a result of his excessive use of sand.\n\nHis attire consists of simple cloth clothing, dressed over with some light leather padding. At the centre of this fox hangs a surcoat, holding the sigil of the Voldunai. Additionally, Lupo has cloth bindings wrapped around both his shins and forearms. Though it may be obvious to some that these are to cover the marks of his slave life, he tries to avoid bringing any attention to it that may lead to unwanted questioning. Finally, strapped upon his back is a ceramic gourd. Roughly the size of his torso, this gourd is filled to the brim with sand. Sand that Lupo can call to his aid for whatever need he may have for it.\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689257742984282129/743071920723067020/lupo800px.png*Half body art of Lupo!} drawn by {link*https://twitter.com/glowcrow*Glowcrow!}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741188065187332148/809169479182450739/lupo_orig_wm.png?width=712&height=852*Full body comission of Lupo!} drawn by the amazing {link*https://twitter.com/glowcrow*Glowcrow} once again!\n\n",

Though for much of his younger life, he lived amongst his kin. Running across the dunes in caravans in search of scavenging, trading, and of course, hiding from The Faithless.\n\nLupo was still just a kit when his life took a terrible turn. Being the curious Vulpera he continues to be today, the much younger Lupo ventured out a little too far from the encampment. He had spotted another young vulpera, one he was sure wasn't amongst his caravan party was before him in the dunes. Their actions seemed playful, beckoning Lupo to follow. He did so rather willingly, completely oblivious to what would happen to him. The Vulpera led him to a small ridge within the dunes, far enough from his caravan for them to be unable to hear or see him. Within the ridge he was quickly set upon by a group of Sethrak. The vulpera he had followed was bait. A slave of the Sethrak and now, Lupo would share the same fate.\n\nHe spent the rest of his childhood and even the early stages of adulthood within captivity. As if life in the dunes wasn't hard enough, he became the very thing his kin sought to avoid. The life of a slave took its toll on all Vulpera and Lupo was no different. Continuous labour work had began to get the better of him. He had nearly given up. On the verge of being broken. His body was frail, as was his mind. Dehydration left him with little to no strength. Lupo would finally reach his limit during a day of heavy labour, the sun at its highest peak as the heat absorbed what little energy he had left. Collapsing to the floor, he looked out into the distant dunes, he reached out towards it. He could hardly even hold his arm up, slumping to the floor he gripped the sands within his hand. His eyes became heavy, slowly drifting in and out of unconciousness until within moments, it took him. It was here, that he had a vision. The sands spoke to him. Despite being on the verge of breaking completely, they admired his will he carried with him. To remain headstrong in the face of what more often than not certain death for his kin in the life of a slave, along with the vigilance he had of keeping in line with the Sethrak in hopes of one day finding the time to gain freedom. It seemed that today was that day.\n\nHe woke from his unconsciousness, still weakened and dehydrated. A group of Sethrak hovering over his body. They deemed him useless for work and so, prepared to dispose of him.  No, he wouldn't allow them. He mustered up the strength to raise a hand in defence and with that, the sands answered. They raised with his hand, shooting out from the sands in the form of spikes, impaling the Sethrak that surrounded him. How? He thought. Within moments of what he saw in his vision, he had the ability to manipulate the sands so easily. He felt stronger and so, more determined. He used the sands to wrap around his chains, crushing them under its weight and then doing so with the rest of the Vulperan slaves he was with. They made their escape from the Sethrak, going seperate ways soon after. Lupo would not take this gift bestowed upon him for granted. From then, he would regularly meditate and communicate with the elements and the sands, seeking to learn and understand them greater and in turn, bettering his abilities.",

He had a happy childhood, he met his wife Alana while he was still an apprentice mage, their romance flourished, she was his polar opposite, confident and outgoing. Their love eventually culminated in the birth of his first daughter, Sa'Rah. She, like her parents followed the path of magic. Soon after his second child was born, a son, named Dar'Belore\n\nDisaster\n-Astrans happiness was not to last forever, and like all good things, came to an end. When Arthas invaded Silvermoon, Astran watched as the undead armies ripped his wife and still infant son to shreds and impaled his teenaged daughter. Astran barely survived himself. When all was said and done, he buried what remained of his wife and son, the corpse of his daughter was never found. He fell out of the public perspective, falling into a deep depression and becoming a recluse refugee, all hope for him had died that day and he had all but given up on life.\n\nRecent events:\n\nRe-emergence\n-Astran came out of his self imposed exile recently during the Legion invasion, taking up arms. In part, to try and deal with his survivors guilt, and in part, to find purpose. He joined the military organisation The Blazing Phoenix.\n\nAdopted a daughter (Ily'ana)\n-after a spree of murders around Silvermoon occured, the Blazing Phoenix went to investigate, only to discover that a woman had enchanted her daughters doll to commit these horrific crimes, upon investigating the child, Astran discovered that the daughter of the woman had the potential to become a powerful mage, so upon the defeat of the woman, he elected to adopt the girl and become her teacher. (present age: 6)\n\nDrums of War Campaign\n-Astran was part of the Horde war effort against the alliance after the Legion Invasion was vanquished. However, the war taxed him and played on his conscience heavily, even bringing about physical changes, his hair turned from golden blonde to white, and those paying close enough attention would see he aged very suddenly. He served as a Scout, Combat Mage, and managed part of the logistical efforts with his portals. Where he could, he served as a secretary at meetings, and saw to magical defences.\n\nLordship\n-With the return of his younger brother, Astran has finally accepted his position as Lord of House Dawnhaven.

Her pointed chin draws you up along her long face, accented with cheekbones typical to that of her race. Her eyes offer a soft emerald glow, brightening to a winters blue during her invocation of Arcane. Despite her simplistic beauty, her eyes are slightly narrowed and inquisitive, questioning moreso at times than her cherub lips. \n\nShe holds herself with grace attributed to those of her kin, a frosted aura chilling those whom stand too close. Those whom explore past the untouchable facade find themselves in the company of a mature and light hearted Sin'dorei.\n\nOften at her slender neck sits a necklace made from small critter bones, they have been polished and painted with a clear resin, smooth to touch and quite decorative; A gift from her friend Alastier.\n\n\n\n{h2}Short History{/h2}\nThis creative Mage found her passions through transmutation, particularly frost forging sculptures of intricate details. She may be recognised from her time spent studying and tutoring in Dalaran on artistic classes for extra credit, or less likely from a time where she wore the Sunreaver tabard as a Mage hunter. She has performed occassionally at weddings, festivals and funerals armed with her enchanting featherlight range and mystical instruments. More recently, Juniaa has been focused on overcoming her aminosity towards the Kirin Tor through lecturing there, though deep in her heart she still hears the call of the Sunreavers.\n\n",

He wore practical leathers, though they fit tightly to show off every glorious inch.\n\nHe was ruggedly handsome, with a scruffy beard and a long ponytail that reached his tail, curling into ringlets near the end. Each ear was pierced with a silver ring, fastened with a bead of jade, and if he were ever seen topless, similar rings would be seen in his nipples. His body carried several scars from past battles, the most noticable being a nasty looking stab scar on the right side of his neck.\n\nHe was usually found armed with a staff, which seemed plain apart from the various notches along its length.\n\n{link*https://66.media.tumblr.com/be519db40a5c93fcef577014057a7019/tumblr_inline_pa90k6SwJh1tlzv65_1280.png*Pan pride Rin!}\n\n\n{h1}History{/h1}\n\nJust another of the pandaren than came over to join the Horde with the rest of the Huojin.

He addresses those of whom he engages with attentive, golden hues and a mannerly disposition; speaking clearly in a level yet deep voice.\n\nHis tone is ever steady - each word he announces is akin to slow-dripping honey, whilst every syllable spoken is offered dedicated pronounciation. The male's words evidently uphold a striking Thalassian accent.\n\nThe man's demeanor can only be described as being fairly stiff and tense, though such is only typically observed when he resides among bustling crowds or if he is involved with the typical formalities.\n\nThe sin’dorei harbours blazing, golden eyes that seem to pierce whomever is unfortunate enough to earn their hardened glare. Even his usual vacant glance may result in those on its receiving end to feel a certain edge of discomfort - the man seemingly unable to decipher when he is staring for just a little too long.\n\nA sharp nose, chiselled jaw and defined cheeks grace the man’s face; as well as thinly-shaped, crimson brows - with darkened, lengthy lashes that also bear that infamous reddened tint. \n\nIf the man wasn't already quite imposing enough - he also bears two extensive, thinly-cut scars upon the right side of his face; one stretching rather cruelly from his brow and down past his eye, while another has been slashed horizontally directly across his nose.\n\nRoandil's cascading drapes of scarlet tresses are a prominently rich, deep crimson in colour. His hair is quite long and often styled quite fancifully, the ruby locks reaching far past his shoulders. The radiant, vibrant nature of his fiery strands may stand out considerably even when compared to others - the gossamer stream of hair seeming to always sport a rather grand, pristine sheen to them.\n\nA generous amount of vermilion hair decorates the lower portions of the man's features, stretching from below his ear, across a chiselled jaw and forming a neatly trimmed and cared-for beard upon his chin and around his labium.\n\nOrnamenting the man’s entire left torso - decorating from right below his ear and leading a blazing trail along his toned form, eventually halting upon his left wrist - are an assortment of intricately designed and carefully placed runic tattoos. Their golden flare seems to shine just as brightly as the man’s fervent eyes; ranging from dynamic, curling swirls to more jagged and finely scripted etchings. \n\nThese runes do bare an elven nature to them - but not entirely. If one is familiar and knowledgeable enough, they may be able to depict and note the rather foreign yet more precisely encrusted runes of a more draenei heritage.{/col}{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\prestige-icon-5-1:128:128}{h3}{col:c3c3c3}When left to his own devices, Roandil is a relaxed, gentle man - often viewed to be engaged in numerous activities of which he dearly enjoys. \n\nDue to this, he is frequently seen keeping to himself, the sin'dorei rather simply being one of whom does not actively seek out much attention nor trouble from others. \n\nThe devout is far more eager to devote himself and his time to his faithful practise, solemn duties and seemingly endless studies; as well as remaining present when and where he is required.\n\nWhile he is a rather looming and exceptionally toned man - as well as typically upholding a fairly stoic demeanor - Roandil is not the stern, vacant shell he sometimes offers himself to be.\n\nIf one is dedicated enough to try explore the depths of this elf, they may yet discover he is but a hardened bulwark of which shields a soft interior.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://vocaroo.com/1iChp3VVEOvp*~ Roandil's Voice Reference ~}{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://youtu.be/koZRzhY321A*~ A Musical Depiction of Roandil ~}{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\prestige-icon-5-4:128:128}",

His parents have been hunters in the area for as long as he can remember, having moved to there before he was born. They lived in the untamed wilds, away from the settlements and out of the faction's their reach. They would only seek civilization when they had to trade for supplies that nature could not easily provide.\n\nThe Marsh is a harsh and dangerous area and so some are not too picky on who to make allies with. \"Anyone not pointing a weapon at you is your friend.\" is the saying some live by. As a result, Truun's family traded with both factions. His Orcish and Common are more fluent than his Taurahe as this was actually not spoken much, not even by his parents.\n\nAlthough his parents are hunters, they refrained from using ranged weapons such as bows. They said that \"your kill isn't worth anything if you don't work for it hard enough, that you should not let the winds do the work for you\". As such, Truun has done a lot of running in his youth.\n\nLife in the Marsh was hard. Dangerous animals roamed around, the black dragonflight would sometimes darken the skies and the grimtotem always kept you on edge. When Theramore fell, tension rose. Those that could be relied on for trade before, could not be relied on anymore, or worse. \n\nOver time, these harsh conditions made Truun wonder why his parents once decided to move to the Marsh, why they left their tribe, what their tribe even was. It were questions that his parents never gave answers to, their tribe was never spoken about. As his unexpected connection with the elements grew, these questions became more burning. \n\nSo it was then, when Truun once again asked about his parent’s past, that his father spoke the words that would mark the beginning of Truun’s departure from the Marsh. This was a few years ago, after the occurence of the cataclysm and the fall of Theramor.\n\nHe still hasn't found any answers, but he did find a tribe he can call his own.\n",

						["TX"] = "{h3:c}The Afterthought (Theraz'gor the Earthshaper){/h3}\n\nWhile his tribe was in Highmountain, Truun visited the spirit walkers in Thunder Totem hoping to learn more about how to handle his red proto drake. Once there, the only advice he got was to go to Neltharions Lair alone. While he was there, he experienced a vision about Neltharion in his former lair in High Mountain. After the vision, he discovered a big two handed axe while trying to find his proto drake, who was sitting next to it. After asking the Spiritwalkers, it seems this wasn't a weapon one of their people had accidentally left behind. He named it \"The Afterthought\", referring to the rather odd ‘on the side’ discovery of it after the vision. The weapon already had a name of its own however.\n\nIt was only after the assistance of a member of the Earthen Ring that set up a ritual that the true name of the weapon became known. During the ritual, an earth elemental emerged and revealed that the weapon was called \"Theraz'gor the Earthshaper\". It was created by Neltharion and his servants with the purpose of being passed down as a tool to his most trusted champion's in the time to come. Champions that would help him in his duties and lighten the burden that weighed so heavily on him. However, this time never came as his mind slipped into madness. \n\nIt is as yet unknown why Truun happened upon this weapon.",

He carries a broad shield on the back, and a smaller sword at the belt. Two rather nasty skinning knifes are seen connected and bound to his thighs.\n\nHis belt is heavy and seems to carry its weight and burden in the satchel, it emits a vibrating bright green glow.

She had a natural talent for stealth, moving unseen and sometimes getting back home with a few extra coins pickpocketed from someone's bag. \n\nHowever, her childhood was mostly uneventful, the noble origins of her family long forgotten, she helped at home and in her father's workshop.\n\nStill, she never quite outgrew the childhood dream for adventure and journeying beyond the safety of Quel'Thalas, still taking any opportunity to wander around in the city, listen to the tales of travelers in the taverns and sneaking around in Murder's Row, spying on the unsavory characters that could usually be found there.{col:ffffff}{/col}\n{h1:c}Sorrow{/h1}\nBut any dreams she may have had were lost among the ruins of her homeland. When the Scourge invaded she barely escaped Fairbreeze with his brother, her parents lost at the hands of the undead horde. Silvermoon didn't prove any safer, once the Lich King breached the city's gates she was rushed with other children and survivors to Sunstrider Isle, on a last ditch effort to fend off the onslaught.\n\nWhen all was said and done she was lucky, as there weren't many High Elves -now called Blood Elves in memory of those lost- still drawing breath.\n{h1:c}A new path{/h1}\nThese events had a profound impact on her. Both brothers were taken as apprentices at the Temple, but Lidril quickly found that her calling lied elsewhere. Wanting to serve her people and her land, her skills were of use as a spy in service of Silvermoon, at a moment where the Blood Elves were short on allies and still shook by the destruction and the loss.\n\n\n\n",

She was excited for the possibilities and knowledge she would get to accumulate. \n\nThen the Scourge came, as the Lich King laid waste to the Silvermoon City, Magistix Yumana Summerbreeze and her apprentices rose up to defend it and it's people alongside many forces of Quel'thalas. \n\nMaaevena and her fellow apprentices were all leading a smaller group of mages and were tasked with varying orders given by the Magistrix to ensure the safety of the civilians. That was the last time mother and daughter stoody side by side. \n\nDuring the aftermath of the Sunwell's corruption, Magistrix Yumana Summerbreeze and her own troop of mages were counted among the casualties who had fallen to the Scourge. Overwhelmed with grief not only by her own mother's death but many others as well Maeveena burned with rage and foolishly charged into the remaining scourge. While she managed to scorch those that crossed her path she eventually had exhausted herself. Surrounded by the undead without almost no way out she was then rescued by a longtime friend and a fellow mage, Alecksius Brightwisp, who was seeking her on behalf of her worried father.\n\nHowever, soothing the burning rage and grief within the heart of the fire mage was not possible, not for her father and not even for the man who conjured and manipulated ice itself. \n\nMaeveena picked up the mantle of her mother, not officially as a magistrix, but as one of her pupils and kept vigil alongside other mages and knights to keep Scourge at bay, away from the city and civilians as long as it was necessary. This made her turn to fel magic like many of her peers, to keep their magic sustained and powerful enough to keep fighting. \n\nWIP~",

Some might consider the plainness of her an appealing attribute but you won't be seeing her on any pin-up calendars ever. \n\nHer face lacks any make-up whatsoever. The skin around her eyes are a darker hue of green than the rest of her face. A few freckles can be found below her eyes. She has a rather small nose for a goblin but has the usual full lips. \n\nA few nothces can be found at her ears. One bit that was torn off, a few snips here and there, but Dotty still wears earrings of all sorts. \n\nHer body is average as well. It has some decent proportions sure and she has a bit of a belly on her. It's mostly covered up in clothes so nothing really stands out about that part of her. \n\nIf you ever were to see her without a shirt on, and, why would you? You would see tattoos inked onto her skin from shoulder to navel. An intricate pattern of which the origin is known only to Dotty and perhaps the person who actually tatood it. \n\n\n\n\n",

In fact, his scientific studies and high proficiency as a mage are clear indicators that he is one very smart fox, even though he seldom shows or admits it. He believes that one of the greatest gifts one can possess is to be underestimated.\n\nHis studies often have him travelling vast distances across Azeroth, and sometimes even beyond. Therefore, he generally stays alone so he can devote himself to his studies without having other responsibilities on the side.\nHe has small observatories or hidden equipment placed in many spots all across Azeroth. These help him measure important readings that contribute to his research. Therefore, it is not uncommon for him to appear in places where a Vulpera usually wouldn't be.\n\nAs for magic, he mostly focuses on the arcane schools of pyromancy, astromancy, divination, telemancy, illusion and transmutation.\n\nNext to his studies of the universe and magical arts, Ayli is also a zoologist. Although much less proficient at zoology than astronomy and magic, he is still quite good at it! And he often shows how much he loves and cares about animals and nature.",

Little is known about his time in the Dark Horde with the exception of a few accounts by the Dark Iron Dwarfs.\n\nAfter that though there was little sightings of Mardock, he did not appear again till after the fall of Rend Blackhand where he was spotted leading raiding parties across the wetlands,Twilight Highlands and Redridge Mountain.It’s speculated he was following the orders of one Malkorok during these times but the leadership of the Blackrock Clan was still disputed so this is unclear.\n\nDespite numerous complaints from Horde Leadership the Blackrock Clan members were granted amnesty via a warchiefs decree (decree given by Garrosh Hellscream) due to this Mardocks crimes as a member of the Dark Horde have been forgiven and removed from his file.\n\nDespite being given a chance to join the Horde and the Korkron by Hellscream it appears Mardock did not take his offer and instead left to pursue privateer work, why so is unclear. Despite this It appears he made decent contacts among the Steamwheel Cartel and may of used these to aquire a Mercenary status within the Horde which has granted him limited accsess to Horde territories after the fall of Hellscream.\n\nHe did request to join the Horde at a later time but was denied on the ground's of past deed's within the Dark Horde, Warlord Greya who oversaw his application committed \"You have been granted extraordinary favour for a warrior with your reputation...the fact you were allowed to keep your head is a miracle unto itself. But if you think I would allow the Horde to be sullied further by allowing a dishonourable monster like you to walk among our ranks you a greatly mistaken!\"\n\n\n",

She is an Orcess who is unapologetically fond of what she perceives to be the finer things in life. This ranges from an adoration of gold to fine wines and perhaps above all else that euphoric high of sating a deeply rooted Fel addiction. She is a woman of Shadowmoon Clan origin, a clan once associated with deep Shamanistic ties that were ultimately overshadowed by a fascination with Fel and Demonology and Nazarga was certainly no exception.\n\nThis fascination and ultimately life long effort to embrace her studies of Demonology ultimately led her to spend a great deal of her time not only in neutral circles such as the Black Harvest but also in Quel'thalas among the Blood Elves rather than with her own kind in kalimdor. Tensions may have been high in their own respective regards but a society that proved more open to Felmancery and Demonology certainly suited her well.\n\nThis has quite clearly rubbed off on Nazarga more than she'd ever care to admit seeing as the Orcess in question has developed a love not only for finer silks but also more Elven inspired jewelry as well as her iconic pair of excessively tall thigh-high heels! \n\nSavage warpaint, thigh high heels, armors decorated with the skulls of her enemies but often one to flaunt well manicured long nails; she is a woman torn between cultures and yet that's just part of what makes Nazarga the self assured, well traveled Orcish Warlock of unsatiable ambition that she is.{/col}\n\n\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:c50000}DESCRIPTION{/col}{/h3}\n{col:ffc2a9} Nazarga has incredibly long and luscious raven black hair that is more often than not fashioned in to a highly positioned and strainingly tight ponytail. The prominence of the tail's height combined with the  benefit of keeping her hair out of her face has made it a favourite to stand the test of time! There are times that you may spot her with even if only the faintest streaks of grey in her hair but those moments are short lived. Whether this means that she pays regular visits to a barber shop or far more likely that she's due to engage in further magical meddling to maintain her youth is only for her t know for sure.\n\nThis raven black hair of hers stands in contrast to a distinct and rather dark skin colour of a traditional Orcish green. Her even dark hue also serves to make those brilliantly bright burning red eyes of hers stand out all the more so. Whether her wide and almost glowing red eyes are pretty or fearsome is surely up to the observer to decide but what remains a constant is that her eyes remain as a testimony to the Warlock's ever present and deeply rooted fel corruption. This is not an Orc who has sought to lean away from Demonic energies; this is an Orc who has chosen to bathe in them in abundance and enjoy each moment of doing so to the fullest.\n\nHer face is otherwise rather angular and sharp, from a fairly defined jawline, a slightly pointy chin and prominent cheekbones; it is only thanks to those wide red eyes of hers and her plush, pillowy pair of lips that she looks considerably more soft and approachable than she otherwise might have.\n\nLooking below her face and long elegant neck one may witness this Orcess' tall and eyecatching physique. Her shoulders are of average width and whereas there is a good amount of muscular definition across them as well as her arms and black; it's clear that her musculature is of a lean and agile variety rather than any bulky or what so ever \"masculine\" looking sort. She leads an active lifestyle and has generally the same amount of strength one might expect from just about any individual of proud Orcish breed!\n\nHigh upon her chest this Warlock sports and quite often flaunts what is either the result of some very special genetics or perhaps even the spellwork motivated by greatvanity. Her bosom is incredibly large and those frankly enormous Orcish melons look considerably more full and perky than what should be possible for a bust of such size. Whether she wears something that's intentionally flaunting or even a tabard that's supposed to be all covering; truly concealing her chest from sight tends to be easier said than done.\n\nBeneath her chest one may se how her figure slims down in to a waspishly thin waistline the front of which is decorated by chiseled abs looking as if sculptured out of stone to near perfection. This contrast between her chest, her slender waistline and then those far wider shelf-like hips only further accentuates an eyecatching silhouette. \n\nWith a large but well trained and shapely bottom that matches the width of her impressive hispan this Orcess' tall height soon comes in to play. The sole reason for why she stands above the average of her kind is without a doubt those incredibly, as if endlessly long legs of hers. With lengthy thighs that combine just the right amount of muscular definition with soft padding alike; she looks as powerful as she does graceful when making her way forth a top of those tall thigh-high heels that one will only very rarely catch her without.\n\n {/col}\n\n{h3:c}RP HOOKS{/h3}\n\n- She worked actively with the Black Harvest during the Legion crisis but since then she has not! Someone associated wiht them may recognize her.\n\n- She spent many years in Silvermoon after the Sin'dorei joined the Horde, exchanging information about Arcane and Fel with the talented Elven Magi.\n\n- Driven by her own greed and desires you are equally likely to have seen her happily converse with those of the opposite faction as you are to have seen her rob and enslave them.She is not driven by racial hatred but rather by pure cold objective pragmatism. If there's going to be a war, then she'd rather the side just so happens to be a part of win!  Happily converse with humans or Night Elves in booty bay without any hatred what so ever? Sure!  Track down, rob and enslave people of the Alliance for some quick profit to feed herself and her loved ones when she's short on coin? Also sure!\n\n- Rumours suggest that even though she's left the Shadowmoon Clan behind for obvious reasons; she refuses to consider herself Clanless. She's named herself Chieftan of her own micro-clan with just a few individuals in it in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h3:c}OOC STUFF BELOW{/h3}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis note shouldn't be necessary but I've seen a lot of custom OOC statuses saying things like \"I ignore X\" or \"I don't RP with Y\" lately, so I'm going to write it anyhow. I am very super duper happy to RP with anyone and everyone who isn't a blatant and obvious troll.\n\nI am happy to roleplay with people who belong to the PCU and people who do not belong to the PCU. I am happy to RP with Male toons, female toons, femboy toons, I happily do cross faction Rp, non Cross Faction RP, I happily rp with people from guild X and guild Y, yada yada yada yada, the list goes on!\n\nMaybe our characters won't get along at all, or maybe they will! Let's allow IC interaction to decide that, not premature judgments from an OOC side of things.\n\nWith that said: characters created purely for the sake of hunting ERP that are void of any kind of personality, depth, history or really any other purpose what so ever are respectfully asked to steer clear. I may ERP on occasion if Nazarga has found herself a lover by realistic and immersive story advancing means, but Goldshire-esque hookups just aren't my jam!\n\n\n",

Striking blue eyes and perfectly plush lips jostle for attention, harmoniously accented by a petite nose and slim eyebrows.\n\nHer impressively fit and well formed physique is a head turning sort, the otherworldly beauty of her kind refined through hardship and the rigors of an active life. A slim neck leads down to a modest chest, toned abdominal muscles and well sculpted arms that end in hands toughened from manual work. The pear-like silhouette defining shape of her hips leads down to dangerously powerful thighs, hiking ready calves and hooves that promise to deliver disorienting kicks!\n\nAn alchemist turned intrepid adventurer, Mixalia’s choice of attire is far from ostentatious. Robust and trim clothing fit for travel in a variety of climates and outfitted with all sorts of pockets and pouches. She tends towards earthy shades and often wears a moss green tabard dedicated to the city of Shattrath that’s associated with the sanctuary’s lower city and its residence. Iconography that’s both a sombre reminder and symbolic of the hope and respite Shattrath offered so many.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h2:c}{col:DE5E3E}Public Information{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-BurntEarth:512:4}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}With much of her professional life having been dedicated to the study of alchemy, it’s common knowledge that she creates and sells all manner of both common and rare potions, balms and tinctures!\n\nAn empathetic sort, Mixalia is known to have provided relief and assistance to the innumerable refugees that flocked to Shattrath City in the wake of Outland’s world bending collapse. She also provided similar help to those who fled Teldrassil for Stormwind following its destruction.\n\nTumultuous decades required many Draenei, including Mixalia, to learn how to defend themselves. She's alleged to be competent!{/col}{/p}\n",

The unruly locks, some of which are often loose from the rubber band holding it away from the demon hunter's face, also have many streaks of white hair in them. He also sports a well maintained and trimmed beard around his mouth that is reaching down to his collarbones and is braided into two seperate parts, having the startings of losing its blonde colour to white as well. \n\nFrom behind his blindfold, one can tell he used to be a handsome man. Now, his face is covered by a large, mask-like blindfold, not only hiding his felflame eyes, but a visage marred by scars, some glinting of fel energy from under the split skin. Most visible, is the two diagonal cuts on hte right side of his cheek, one stretching below his jawline, and the large, vertical slash running up from behind his blindfold, where his left eye used to be, and reaching up to a good portion of his forehead. His stride and stance betray not only centuries spent close to combat, but the weariness of an age not many blood elves live to see; he appears ready to jump into combat, keeping his shoulders slightly braced and his feet apart, but lacks the energetic steps and gestures of young soldiers. \n\nThe demon hunter's tattoos are the traditional fel green with a curved pattern. He has unusually numerous markings across his body, but most of them are hidden by armour or clothing. He usually wears using arms and armour commonly seen in use by sellswords or adventurers, fit both for fighting long battles, as well as travelling for long periods of time with a heavy, hooded cloak he can fully pull around himself to stave off the elements.\n\nThe blood elven illidari's musical tone of voice is contrasted by a hoarseness that seems to be ever present whenever he speaks - as if he either spoke too much recently, or has gotten too used to not speaking at all. \n(Reference: Matt Ryan as Edward Kenway) {/col}\n\n{col:be1119}Trophies{/col} {col:22ff1b} (items acquired during RP): \n\n- Wedding Ring: Always worn under his gloves, is a golden eband decorated with small, circular glass pieces around the rim.\n\n- Ship in a Bottle: Although not carried around on his person, the former sailor possesses an item he holds in great sentimental value - the model of a thalassian brig, handpainted beautifully, inside a bottle. \n\n- Cleaner's Bracers: Two razor sharp blades attached to a pair of metal bracers with a springing mechanism that allows them to shoot forward at the wielder's behest. Useable as both a hidden wristblade and as a regular dagger. Both blades bare similar enchantments and runes as his shortsword. \n\n- Lilithriel's Pendant: Deep in Lytherael's pocket - and while very rarely, but occasionally worn - is a ruby on a golden chain, enchanted with a slight magical aura.\n\n- Nomhi's figurine: A wooden figurine made from a tree grown in the Eversong Woods, made in the image of Lyth himself, standing tall with weapons in hand. \n\n- Silvermoon Hearthstone: An often utilized magical tool that allows Lytherael to return to Silvermoon City from anywhere in the world, three times in every twenty-four hours.{/col}",

He was a legen among his clan - The burning blade - being one of the advisors the the chieftain. He has few sibling which he scarecely talks about, and also had a wife and dozen children. His wife died before the Orcs journeyed onto Azeroth, and his children now roam the world as adventurers and legends in their own right. Not long after the Orcish invasion, due to a certain incident Koruz went into Exile, becoming a hermit wandering about Azeroth, which is also the reason for his near nonexistant fel taint. However, after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits and their attempts to reform the Horde, he made his way back to his former comrades, hoping to forge his honor anew, and make up for the sins of his past.\n\n{h2:c}Current events{/h2} {icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nThese days Koruz is part of the inner circle of Darkheart company, serving as it's secondary leader. Unfortunately at the end of the last campaign while attempting to save his comrades he was gunned down by a rogue ethereal, resulting in his arrival to the Shadowlands. After some time journeying and battling through the land of the dead, he managed to find a gateway that allowed him to return from the land of the damned.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2} {icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is considered an elder among his kin, living for quite a long time, he gathered scars and marks across his body. However for an orc his age he is still strong and of good physique, making many wonder how mighty he was in his younger years. Even now not many orc can match his strenght, and fewer can match his skill with the blade. The only thing that truly betrays him to his true age is his hair, as it's unmistakingly silver color stands quite out.\n\n{h2:c}Personality{/h2}\nKoruz's personality can be strange to some. For most people he may seem rough around the edges, still more accomodating and less aggresive than a normal orc. Speaking in a more rough tone, and preffering to speak as little as nescessary to people he doesen't know. To his fellows and people who he takes pity upon, his personality becomes quite different. His voices smoothens out taking on more of a caring tone, and becomes more soft. His overall demeanor changes that to a caring father.\n\n{h2:c}Experimental{/h2}\n\n5 HP\n1 Mana\n4 Adrenaline\n\nTrait: Garrosh did nothing wrong!\n",
