As such, she trained twice as hard when duty called for her - and it showed. \n\nClad in light-weight, magically infused plate armor, she carried herself with a sense of purpose. Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

The crane is a rare bird, not found in many numbers; it is even harder to find a young crane.\nThe birth of a crane is rare and raising one is often kept in secret by the parents. They protect their children extremely well and are devoted and patient with the cause.\nFor this reason the crane is seen as the symbol of a parent and a teacher, a person great at keeping secrets, planning in silence with true patience.\nThey move with grace and beauty and seem very serene animals. This tattoo often fits a caring person be they a teacher, healer, mother figure or caring leader.\n\n\n{h1:c}What happened{/h1}\nBefore she got lost and adopted into her new family she was living with her mom and dad in Ashenvale. But one day peaceful just like any other, a demon named Satyr attacked her home. Avasha's parrent were quick the act, and started to strike the demons down Satyr bought to our home, but quickly was overrun. Avasha's mother turned to Avasha and told her to run. Run as far away as she should and dont look back, so she did. Ever since she never saw her parrents again. A couple of days later Avasha was still on the run, as her mother had told her, but was so tired and hungry. She ended up all the way in Darkshore where she collapsed just when she got to Lor'Danel. And this is where she meet her adopted family, Wildrunner...\n\n{h1:c}Forster family{/h1}\nAs young, she was separated from her real parents and got adopted into a new family. she adopted the surname \"Wildrunner\" and became a part of their family her whole childhood. She was raised as a Monk and grew into a lovely lady. With her new family. Even though it wasn't her real family she was still a happy child growing up and tried  to not think about her real family. She even decied around the age of 100 to dye her {col:c6dcde}silver{/col} hair {col:28ff79}green{/col}, to not be reminded of her real mothers. \n\n",

Standing at a height of only 6'4. Which is considered small for Kaldorei male standards. However. One thing that wouldn't dissapoint is his toned frame. A six pack is visible with most clothing the elf wears. Along with admirable muscles. Locks of messy silvery white hair can be seen upon the elf's head, Falling down to his rear. Aswell as his silver head hair, Kal's face was covered up by a similarly silver, rather bushy beard. Obscuring a few scars here and there.\n\nKal bares alot of scars from his many years of combat. Including a quite nasty. Yet small burnmark around his right eye. Despite the burnmark however. His eye wasn't dimmed or injured at all. Aswell as the burnmark. He also had a few scars on his ears. And a fair amount of scars on his chest and face. With all of the scars. His often unkempt appearance, Kal's appearance is very distinct, and near impossible to forget.\n\nSomething one would likely notice about Kal would be his strangely large fangs. A few inches larger than the majority of Kaldorei. Whilst not exactly tusks. They also seem to be slightly sharper when compared to other Kaldorei fangs. If one were to get to see Kal's shirtless body. They would notice a faint tattoo on Kal's left shoulderblade. A purple star. It's hardly noticable anymore. And is almost completely faded. Yet Kal noticably holds the tattoo with high regard. Despite the fact that whip-marks scar most of the surrounding skin.\n\nKal's eyes are a soothing amber colour. Which would be odd for a fair amount of elves. His silvery white hair showing he may be of Highborne blood. But the amber eyes betrayed the hint. Showing that he had a potential for druidic power. But a potential that'd been given up many years ago. Clearly.\n\nSurprisingly. Despite Kal's muscular frame. He has quite the shapely rear. Something that would often stick out like a sore thumb as one looks at him.{/col}\n",

Such as the S.I.R.T: Surface-injury-repair-Tool (Patent pending) A handheld light-powered device that allows one to repair minor cosmetic damage without too much of a fuss.\n{/col}{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sunlight:512:128}",

Surrounded by thick eyelashes and the faintest of hints of makeup, they stand out quite a lot. Fitting to these pale eyes, her pale porceline skin show her leucism. While not as grave as it could be, she is certainly paler than many others.\n\nLong, bleach blonde hair hang in airy curls down to her chest. A few stray locks streak across her right eye at all times, due to how her hair is set, but otherwise nothing to disturb a quite pristine look.\n\nThe scars she carry are many for a woman her age. A band of burnscars linger over her right upper arm and her left upper thigh, looking almost like half garters of burnt skin. While these are often hidden, the lack of her left hand is evident. Chopped off clean at the wrist in an unfortunate event, the stump was burnt to prevent bloodloss. While the skin healed over the flesh gradually, there are burnscars surrounding it from the method used.\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/gallery/bZboHvd*My Art of Olivia}\n\n\n{/h3}\n\n\n\n",

It's rumored that when she cries they glow, but you would have to see to believe such a thing.\n\nNormally seen with her 'eyes' covered in public, it seems she prefers to keep them hidden from other people. When alone or with friends she will reluctantly take her cover off, revealing unusual purple flames.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \nPeople familiar with Elanaris know she had been absent for a while, only knowing she was sent away mysteriously by her Shan'Do: Darkan Shadeclaw and upon her returning it seems she was unable find him...\n\nUntil now.

His daily clothes and boots are cleaned regularly, gear and weaponry often in pristine condition. His manner is usually direct and honest to the bone, minding small details in  many things from conversations to combat, he rarely stops from speaking them out if he thinks it’s a valid point to add and takes his time before reaching any sort of judgement or conclusions. An open-minded fellow with a love for things made with honest effort, a buy it for life approach follows his actions throughout the day. Born in the town of Stormglen, he is a man of nature.

Going by the stink that sometimes accompanies her, she's a sometime functional alcoholic, drinking only occasionally but usually to great excess. The beginnings of a series of deep, red scars begin at the base of her neck - a smacking of lashes received at the end of a whip.\n\nHer equipment is an array of starkly pragmatic armaments, designed for manoeuvrability over protection, and optimal for her short stature. A bandoleer wraps around her chest, covered in Alliance heraldry, and probably of military issue. Littered with ammunition and ordnance, the leather seems only to halt when it reaches the shoulder holster situated on her right side. \n\nOn her right hand, she wears a sharply studded leather gauntlet, whilst a series of medals and trophies are wrapped about the adjoining wrist as makeshift bracelets. Her right arm is covered in a few choice Wildhammer motifs, having received such on her travels. Whatever the reason for her current occupation, she was evidently highly decorated in her military career.\n\n\n\n",

					["TX"] = "Born in Lakeshire to a wealthy merchantile family during the later half of the Second War, Celestania would grow in relative comfort and secruity from the world around her within the comfounds of Everstill House.  Her father, Geoffrey Fairsong had made his fortune in the fishing trade of the region and later arms trade, sellling weapons to local militias fighting the Orc Invaders. He is currently a magistrate on the town council.   Her mother, Sofia Fairsong, was a socialite of the town, hosting many parties and events that brought the community together.  Finally there was her older brother, Vincent Fairsong, heir to the Fairsong Estate and Leuitanant in the Redridge Brigarde.   She once had an older brother, Duncan, who war killed on patrol in Eastern Redright by an Orc Warlock five years ago.  This has led to Celestania having a grave distrust and dislike of all warlocks.\n\nCelestania would eventually leave her home of Evenstill House, away from the fondness of the Country region to join life in the big city and capital, Stormwind.  She had grown tired of life in the country and of young men wishing to make her their wife.  She wanted adventure, she wanted excitment, she wanted to be like her brother, a soldier, a Watchman.  \n\nAfter making a few coins working as a waitress in Goldshire's Lion's Pride Inn, where she would be frequently gawked at and harrassed by the male visitors, she would venture to the big city of Stormwind, where she struggled to find work in the Inns there as a barmaid.  Eventually she was offered a postion as a Footman in the city's Crownwatch, learning to patrol the streets and keep the King's Peace.  \n\n\nHard times would befall upon the Crownwatch toward the end of Winter Veil that year, a schism would occur where may of the prominent ranks had grown disenchanted with its leader, one Lord Allijah Farrow, citing his ill leadership and mismangement of the situation.  Nearly all of the Crownwatch would leave the City Hall, save for the Captain, his Worgan Lance Constable, a man known as Godfrey, a Kul Tirian named Thor, a Dwarf known as Mack, and Celestania herself, knowing loyality was the most important thing right now to the peace of Stormwind. \n\n\nThe newly forged King's Watchman would immediently fall upon hard times, the King himself stripping much of the Watchman's funding away, seeing too many Watch guilds in the city.  To add fuel to the matter, the Warch's Captain, Lord Farrow, would shy away from the world, leaving matters of the Watch to his appointed Seargent, Thor to deal with.  With more cutbacks, with more walkouts, the rank and file of the Watch would find hope with the prospect of a merger with the City Watch, a prominent group of Watchmen in the city.  \n\nIn her hour need she turned to the Light for guidance, and was warmly taken in by the brothers and sisters of the Light in Stormwind Cathedral.  She attended study at Northshire Abbey in the ways of the Light and training to become a Priestess.  She learnt to give back to others and that strength in the world would come unity with those around her.  She would eventually be sent out into the world to help spread the good word and bring others into the Light where darkness extends.  \n\nHer story continues...",

With no recollection of who they used to be, they lived on the streets of Stormwind City, unable to remember information for very long at all before it's lost in the whispers of their mind, and struggling to keep their attention focussed on things they should really focus upon. \nThey've since found a way to regain their lost memories, finding that doing so also returned them to being Lerondir instead of \"Scratch\".

The family reputation was well and truly ruined by this event, meaning the remaining four remaining Dawnlight siblings had to work hard to try and improve their social standing again.\n-They're quite often seen with a scruffy rat upon one shoulder, running or bounding around the streets of Stormwind, either a mask or bright smile upon their face.

When she learned to walk, she often wandered around watching nature and peopple around her.\n\nWhen she was older and stronger, she travelled all around Ashenvale but returned home each day same time to home. Also she kept her mother and father on map, about where she has been. She sometimes even asked where she could go.\n\nOne day, a sentinel patrol engaged horde patrol and bouth sides had losts. The sentinel's comed to village, where Fylaenia lived. She watched her mother, when she went to sentinel's and quided them to their house. \n\nIn their house, Fyla's mother mended sentinel's and she did notice Fylaenia watching her. When the sentinel's were mended, they thanked Fyla's mother and rided of the town. Then, Fyla's mother, aproached Fyla and asked if she was interested of work what she did. Fyla nodded and beamed a warm smile, while she answers ''yes''.\n\nFrom that moment, Fyla learned arts of mending from her mother and her faith becomed strong toward Elune during that time.\n\n{h2:c}Adulthood:{/h2}\n\nWhen she earned her facial mark's, she joined to priestest sisterhood. In there, she honed her skills in mending, spells and knowledge about creatures around her. She often finded herself questioning other sister's thoughs about alliance.\n\nShe was teased and she earned nickname '' The kind'' due teasing. It made Fylaenia  uncomfort, but not too much. She lived fine life with sisterhood, untill she was asked to join brothers and sisters to help peopple in Gilneas. In there, she ended to talk with local's, mend their wounds and often shared tea with them.\n\nWhen she returned to kalimdor, she started to wander. Years passed and Fylaenia kept wandering in Kalimdor, but each year she went to Ashenvale to greet her family.\n\nNow, after fall of Teld'rasil, Fylaenia has spended most of her time in Eastern kingdom serving difrent order and after a year, she has family of three and loving wife, while Fyl works in local shop behind counter.\n\nYear's passed and life smiled on Fylaenia, who had a loving partner and children around her and her partner. Though the feelings beginned to fade away and change, wich leaded Fyleania to leave her partner, yet they are best friends still , even this day.\n\nNow Fylaenia is wandering in Azeroth and enjoying her time with peopple, who she meet and spends time with her family, friends and loved ones .\n\n",

Her eyebrows matches the rest of her bushy hair. \nThe womans face is round and her cheeks are full. A collection of freckles are scattered evenly over her face, neck and shoulder, but the amount increases around her eyes and across the bridge of her nose.

A copper wire runs down the length of it, the ends are attached to a gizmo on the handle and another near the tip. The electric charge it delivers greatly increases its effectiveness - especially against larger targets.\n\nFastened to his belt are some sticks of dynamite and a battle axe, adorned with some teeth. Very large teeth.\n\nSwung across his shoulder is a makeshift flamethrower, which was obviously built from scrap metal and doesn't look very safe. A fancy dagger is fastened to the tip and functions as a bayonet.\n\n{icon:garrison_greenarmor:30}\n{h2}Gear{/h2}\n\nMost of the time, Pekun wears sturdy plate armor. Recently aquired a newer more fetching one.\n\nRarely he's seen with a helmet, opting more often to wear his goggles into battle, for the advantages they give him.\n\n\n\n{icon:inv_helmet_goggles_pandariatradeskill_d_01:30}\n{h3}Goggle features{/h3}\n- Night vision\n- Spyglass function\n- Magnifying glass\n- Experimental fog-nullifier\n- Heat vision\n\n\n{icon:inv_misc_bag_09_black:30}\n{h3}Satchels{/h3}\n\n{icon:inv_firstaid_bandage:25} {icon:inv_misc_bomb_03:25} {icon:inv_misc_enggizmos_swissarmy:25} {icon:inv_tailoring_80_nylonthread:25} {icon:inv_inscription_parchment:25}{icon:inv_archaeology_70_highborne_noblemansletteropener:25}{icon:inv_misc_rope_02:25} {icon:inv_misc_enggizmos_rocketchicken:25}\n(Inventory detail \"soon\")\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-83:64:64}\n---\n{icon:achievement_goblinhead:30}\n{h2}Looks{/h2}\nA Goblin of average hight, but physically fit as his profession requires, Pekun would look to the casual observer like the typical bruiser type.\nRecent battles managed to accumulate more injuries, and thus scars, than all his years as a merc - fighting highwaymen is obviously very different to fighting wars.\nSome cuts and burns are visible (but not obtrusive) on the Goblin's arms. Should one catch him without his armour though, one would find several stab- and shot wounds marring his torso and legs.\n\nPekun's ear-cuff is concealing a sizable hole where a chunk is missing from his right ear. This is obviously the only scar he is actively trying to hide.\n\n\nHis armor is usually kept in good shape. The unobtrusive necklace, sporting several large teeth and claws, that dangles around the Goblin's neck, as well as his single nose piercing, are the only jewellery he wears (aside from his ear-cuff).\n\n---\n{icon:ability_racial_bestdealsanywhere:30}\n{h2}Personality & Quirks{/h2}\n\nPekun tends to call people descriptive nicknames instead of using their actual ones.\n\nHaving spent most of his days as a neutral merc, he doesn't have a lot of faction pride for the Horde. But he's fiercely loyal to his friends and will go through hell and high water to defend them; be it against physical harm or merely verbal offences.\n\nLike many goblins, what Pekun lacks in physical size and strength, he makes up for with his ingenuity. Which is why his spear is modified to increase it's effectiveness especially against larger targets. He loves to tinker, especially when faced with a problem that needs to be overcome. One of the results of this are his patented one-time-use rocket-propelled mail-chickens.\n\n---\n{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled03:30}\n{h2}History{/h2}\nAsk ic ;)\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Wetlands:256:128}",

Her prefered attires are as light as expected from usual Kaldorei kind though she wears as light clothing for casual wear, leaving less covered than showing of her quite much without exception all over freckled skin.\n\nHer body shape is definitely out of ordinary for a kaldorei with eyestickingly excessive bust well over size of her head and plump thick bottom and thighs. Her assets combined with fairly petite rest of her torso made it obvious that she was far from natural, if those well over thumb thick each full plump lips that are always coated in layer of pink glossy lipstick didn't already spoil the artificially enhanced nature of her doll-like curvaceous body.\n \nThere is nearly no case where she wouldn't be seen with light smile or bit confused expression on her makedup face and people who have conversed with her could undoubtedly confirm that she isn't the smartest of her kin but at least she has a good attitude about it. The fact that she wears so plenty of makeup would surely hint towards her not being the most self confident and sure she is unusual with her shortness and all the freckles. She sure isn't the most conventionally beautiful elf which further makes it easy for many to approach her.\n \nShe bears barely any visible markings to her other than a faint old brand like sentinel's moonglaive shaped marking to middle of her right outer plump thigh.\n{/col}\n \n{col:585550}/c/ysanna{/col}",

Her father worked in a workshop building glaivethrowers for the sentinels and her mother was an archer in the Sentinel Army. She learned archery from her mother and basics of engineering from her father. They had a calm life until one day, during an attack by a band of satyrs, her parents were killed and the satyrs took Azura as a sacrifice. She was saved by group of sentinels lead by Allory Storm.

She studied under many different teachers. She could make replica of any schematic that she learned, but for some reason she couldn't invent anything. Upon completing her studies, she was gifted with mechanical cat, whom she called Fluxe.

The times noted is IC time, not OOC, so you have plenty of time to take care of it. No rush. Also; TL;DR big-time, find the one you're afflicted with, ignore the rest.\n\n{h3}{icon:ability_rogue_dualweild:20}  Deadly Poison{/h3} Firstly, the wound would burn, after a few moments the afflicted should feel the burning pain in their whole body. These effects worsen, and after an hour the afflicted should be in critical condition, extremely high fever, organs shutting down, blood clogging up. At this point the afflicted will develop internal permanent damages, even if cured from the poison afterwards. Two or three hours after affliction the person should perish.\n\n{h3}{icon:ability_creature_poison_03:20}  Paralyctic Poison{/h3} The wound would tingle, after a few minutes the afflicted should have trouble moving their limbs, after a quarter hour they should not be able to move much at all. Effects last a few hours, then an hour period with lingering effects, then gone. No permanent damages.\n\n{h3}{icon:spell_nature_nullifydisease:20}  Mind Numbing Poison{/h3} Effects include a glaring headache, problems constructing cohesive thoughts, greatly afflicting spellcasting ability. Effects should kick in almost instantly, and stay active for some hours, then dissipate. No permanent damages.\n\n{h3}{icon:ability_poisons:20}  Instant Poison{/h3} Effects include high pain, similar to both deadly and mind numbing poison. Less deadly however, but if not treated the victim could die within 24 hours. Activates sooner, only a minute or so after affliction.\n\n{h3}{icon:spell_nature_slowpoison:20}  Void Dampening Poison{/h3} After application, the target would have great difficulty reaching for void or shadow magic. Thoughts of connected spells being jumbled up. The effects would worsen over the span of some more minutes, and then the effect would stay for an hour or so. No permanent damages.\n\n{h3}{icon:ability_creature_poison_06:20}  Blood{/h3} Vi’s blood is in itself poisonous. Too many substances have traveled in her veins over the years, tainting the blood. After indigestion, the afflicted would feel nausea and vertigo. Over the span of a quarter hour turn to throwing up and develop a fever. Effects last for an hour or two. Not lethal.\n\n\n{col:666666}(Gambling winnings: 26s){/col}\n",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

If neither makes its apparent enough a closer look at her,warmly glowing feline like eyes and curved ears will confirm it. A subtle hint towards her favored totem animal.\n\nShe  would usually have the strong scent of  flowers and forest about her,but despite the fact she spends much time within the wilderness her long,flowing purple hair is well cared for and brushed.\n\nUnder all that armor and layer of hair,hides her pale and soft skin. At first glance it would seem she hasnt received any scars from her past battles,but on a closer look and once she is not hiding them, you can easily recognise few scars on her legs and arms. Yet the most terrifying scar is usually hidden under her chestguard, left by what one could guess to be a blade.\n\nThe only markings on her pale face are her tattoos that run down on her cheeks,near her warmly smiling and soft lips. Her facial structure is long and thin. Her nose is long and sharp,poking into whatever trouble she can possibly find! Tariel has always appreciated the beauty of gems and shining stones and often decorates herself with simple jewerly. Most impressive piece of her collectionis a pendant representing a sprite,holding a small orb in its claws. As it is so detailed,it is quite fair in size,making it noticeable and to some,it would confirm her origin:the Spritewing family whom use that symbol as their crest. Every piece of jewerly she wears,is made from silver and from the stones and crystals of the nature,quite much like the ones implented on her armor.\n\nNature is always present with the druidess,even in the stone built Cities of the Alliance. She has crafted most of her armor from living bark and allows different kinds of plants take home upon its surface. \n\nSome scribble:\n\n{link*https://www.deviantart.com/xewspaws/art/Scribbling-my-old-fren-823140199* Tari}\n\n{link*https://www.deviantart.com/xewspaws/art/Tariel-v-12345-841970727* Another Tariel by me}\n\nActual Art by the pro's:\n\n{link*https://www.deviantart.com/xewspaws/art/Tariel-Spritewing-and-Meara-839380319* Tariel and her companion by coffeeandbiscuits}\n\n\n{link*https://www.deviantart.com/xewspaws/art/Tariel-and-Meara-by-Coffeeandbiscuits-865146073* Coloured potrait by coffeeandbiscuits}",

His parents have been hunters in the area for as long as he can remember, having moved to there before he was born. They lived in the untamed wilds, away from the settlements and out of the faction's their reach. They would only seek civilization when they had to trade for supplies that nature could not easily provide.\n\nThe Marsh is a harsh and dangerous area and so some are not too picky on who to make allies with. \"Anyone not pointing a weapon at you is your friend.\" is the saying some live by. As a result, Truun's family traded with both factions. His Orcish and Common are more fluent than his Taurahe as this was actually not spoken much, not even by his parents.\n\nAlthough his parents are hunters, they refrained from using ranged weapons such as bows. They said that \"your kill isn't worth anything if you don't work for it hard enough, that you should not let the winds do the work for you\". As such, Truun has done a lot of running in his youth.\n\nLife in the Marsh was hard. Dangerous animals roamed around, the black dragonflight would sometimes darken the skies and the grimtotem always kept you on edge. When Theramore fell, tension rose. Those that could be relied on for trade before, could not be relied on anymore, or worse. \n\nOver time, these harsh conditions made Truun wonder why his parents once decided to move to the Marsh, why they left their tribe, what their tribe even was. It were questions that his parents never gave answers to, their tribe was never spoken about. As his unexpected connection with the elements grew, these questions became more burning. \n\nSo it was then, when Truun once again asked about his parent’s past, that his father spoke the words that would mark the beginning of Truun’s departure from the Marsh. This was a few years ago, after the occurence of the cataclysm and the fall of Theramor.\n\nHe still hasn't found any answers, but he did find a tribe he can call his own.\n",

						["TX"] = "{h3:c}The Afterthought (Theraz'gor the Earthshaper){/h3}\n\nWhile his tribe was in Highmountain, Truun visited the spirit walkers in Thunder Totem hoping to learn more about how to handle his red proto drake. Once there, the only advice he got was to go to Neltharions Lair alone. While he was there, he experienced a vision about Neltharion in his former lair in High Mountain. After the vision, he discovered a big two handed axe while trying to find his proto drake, who was sitting next to it. After asking the Spiritwalkers, it seems this wasn't a weapon one of their people had accidentally left behind. He named it \"The Afterthought\", referring to the rather odd ‘on the side’ discovery of it after the vision. The weapon already had a name of its own however.\n\nIt was only after the assistance of a member of the Earthen Ring that set up a ritual that the true name of the weapon became known. During the ritual, an earth elemental emerged and revealed that the weapon was called \"Theraz'gor the Earthshaper\". It was created by Neltharion and his servants with the purpose of being passed down as a tool to his most trusted champion's in the time to come. Champions that would help him in his duties and lighten the burden that weighed so heavily on him. However, this time never came as his mind slipped into madness. \n\nIt is as yet unknown why Truun happened upon this weapon.",

Imagine a big fat man, a cigar in his mouth with a suit and top hat with a magnificent beard, he was a true Aristocat. Nikolai's Mother was a gleaming embodiment of hope within Nikolai's childhood but it all came to a swift end when he was rather young. \n\nHis Father was a drinker and a heavy gambler, Nikolai would describe him as a selfish Fiend. One night he came in and abused his Mother and sister, he tried giving his Brother's the back bone to fight with him but his Brother's sat and did nothing. This angered Nikolai and ultimately led to a physical fist fight with his Father. Of course being as young as he was he lost the fight but in doing so He left his home, like the fools they were his Brother's and Sister followed..\n\nMany Months would pass where Nikolai, his brother's and sister were on the Streets of Gilneas, stealing fruit from wagon carts and the like until one frightful day the Invasion of the Worgan curse occured, With this advancement Nikolai led him and his siblings home to find his house already raided, unfortunetly his Father was murdered but there was no sign of his mother. His mother Rose was able to escape the conflict of the Curse lest the Forsaken started to invade shortly after, this would lead to Nikolai risking his own life to being enslaved by the Forsaken for a short period amounting him many unique scars..\n\n{col:bc000a}\nDisclaimer: Anything that you find out from him past the point of his History was all IC.\n\n",

There are numerous of scarification upon his body, though one that stands out the most is the single long and deep cruelly healed slash going diagonally from left chest and down to his right side of the abdomen.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h1:c}{icon:achievement_character_human_male:25}{/h1}\n{h2:c}{col:c023f0}Human form:{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3:c}{col:c023f0}When in human form, Cotton still sports an impressive bulk of muscle mass, though it is of course less than when he is in his worgen form. A man that's lived by the sword for his whole life, and it definitely shows even in human form. \n\nThe same slash scar decorates his body on the front as above mentioned.\n\nCotton's hair is blond and so is the beard, he seem to take care of it, but not overly so either. {/col}{/h3}\n",

He was a legen among his clan - The burning blade - being one of the advisors the the chieftain. He has few sibling which he scarecely talks about, and also had a wife and dozen children. His wife died before the Orcs journeyed onto Azeroth, and his children now roam the world as adventurers and legends in their own right. Not long after the Orcish invasion, due to a certain incident Koruz went into Exile, becoming a hermit wandering about Azeroth, which is also the reason for his near nonexistant fel taint. However, after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits and their attempts to reform the Horde, he made his way back to his former comrades, hoping to forge his honor anew, and make up for the sins of his past.\n\n{h2:c}Current events{/h2} {icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nThese days Koruz is part of the inner circle of Darkheart company, serving as it's secondary leader. Unfortunately at the end of the last campaign while attempting to save his comrades he was gunned down by a rogue ethereal, resulting in his arrival to the Shadowlands. After some time journeying and battling through the land of the dead, he managed to find a gateway that allowed him to return from the land of the damned.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2} {icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is considered an elder among his kin, living for quite a long time, he gathered scars and marks across his body. However for an orc his age he is still strong and of good physique, making many wonder how mighty he was in his younger years. Even now not many orc can match his strenght, and fewer can match his skill with the blade. The only thing that truly betrays him to his true age is his hair, as it's unmistakingly silver color stands quite out.\n\n{h2:c}Personality{/h2}\nKoruz's personality can be strange to some. For most people he may seem rough around the edges, still more accomodating and less aggresive than a normal orc. Speaking in a more rough tone, and preffering to speak as little as nescessary to people he doesen't know. To his fellows and people who he takes pity upon, his personality becomes quite different. His voices smoothens out taking on more of a caring tone, and becomes more soft. His overall demeanor changes that to a caring father.\n\n{h2:c}Experimental{/h2}\n\n5 HP\n1 Mana\n4 Adrenaline\n\nTrait: Garrosh did nothing wrong!\n",

To her any warrior must be able to pick up a weapon in the battlefield , any weapon , and use it with deadly precision and efficiency.\nShe however, ever since she could pick up one ,has favoured axes.\n\nHer personal arsenal consists of:\n\n{h3}Primary weapons:{/h3}\n-Her twin axes , forged in the frozen land that is Stormpeaks by an Iron Dwarf runesmith named Bjorst. (Aqquired IC)\n-A great two handed primal looking axe gifted by her mate Azadrin. (Aqquired IC/{link*https://imgur.com/a/GZggo9d*See art} By {link*https://twitter.com/lurrlonde*Lurrlonde!} )\n\n{h3}Secondary Weapons{/h3}\n-A bow crafted by herself during her upbringing. It looks crude and in vrykul fashion. She uses it mostly for hunting.\n-A simple yet giant dagger attached to her belt if in her regular armor. Her plate armor does not carry this.\n-A Two handed mace she uses to pursue \"easier\" contracts . It is a tool to let out her rage more than anything.\n-A vrykul looking shield , simple yet efficient in combat. However being a berserker herself she rarely resorts to such.\n-A two handed sword ,commonly issued by the Alliance military, rusty and of no use anylonger. Sits in her home adorning her wall. \n\n\n{col:0015ff}{/col}\n\n\n{h2:c}Personality{/h2}\n\nRagnavald is ruthless and most times stoic . Yet she is not deprived of emotion .\nThe one quality to bring out her softer side is her years and love of baking before becoming what she is . A link to humanity so to speak.\n\n(Keeping this brief as it is more fun to find out IC)",

His eyes were once red, his body lean and athletic from spending hours at work in his doctors surgery, and after a time where his eyes were green and his body less than athletic, it seems that life with the Bilgewater Battalion has given him muscle to match his bulk and he's even made consciencous effort to draw away from corruption. Aside from his eyes, his head seems to have taken the brunt of the toll which comes from dabbling in the fel, his face being more wrinkled and what was once a full head of hair having fled the top of his head, forming into sideburns which he struggles to keep in check. \n\nHowever, concerning his fashion sense <The next part seems to have been edited heavily> Jastor is a pioneer in good fashion sense, from his black battle ensemble with felforge ventilation to the finery which he wears when interacting with other important people, or attending fanciful functions, the problems brought about by AGING seem to slip away thanks to the Doctors impeccable style choices.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WorkshopHorde:512:256}\n\nI come from humble beginnings. Back on Kezan I lead the simple life of a Doctor after I graduated from Crapopolis U. I lived in Bilgewater Port out of my very own surgery with my family, who I unfortunately had to sell to the insurance company so that I could get tickets aboard Gallywixes Pleasure Yacht because Mount Kajaro went and blew its top whilst I was operating.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-LostIsles:512:256}\n\nHere's a holiday snap I took of the Lost Isles, ok so it was more of a traumatizing shipwreck in which I was attacked by wild animals, almost zombified by pygmies and temporarily enslaved by the Trade Prince but I got to say, the island was beautful. Until it got melted by another volcano...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n\nFor a while after the Lost Isles fiasco, I decided following the Trade Prince who had just enslaved me a week or so ago wasn't really for me. So I ran away with the Darkmoon Faire and learnt myself some warlockery. At first it was just an act, pull the imp out of a tophat, saw a voidwalker in two, but then it became something else, it became a -passion-.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Azshara:512:256}\n\nI've ended up saddled with the Bilgewater Cartel, again. It turns out that carnies don't take kindly to my response to their FALSE accusations being to give them the old finger and fly off in their dirigible. Of course they didn't really expect a guy who was once a fully qualified doctor (I still am by the way), to roll up dressed as a mad scientist. So they assigned me somewhere, let's just say my time in Azshara was short lived as it turns out 'they don't want their lumber turned into charcoal', ingrates...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Felwood:512:256}\n\nWhere did I end up? Felwood of course, where else would a Goblin warlock of my talents end up but in the back end of nowhere surrounded by the remnants of a once great empire of treehuggers and hippies, hidden away from the rest of the world to do my work.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-FelForge:256:128}\n\nBut don't you worry, ladies and gentlemen, the good old doctor still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and in this little pocket of fel infested paradise, my final trick is already in the making...",

His imposing height, trained physique and distant stare is often an indicator that he is no stranger to battle, but in reality, his calm disposition emanates kindness that is unmistakable. A tall giant with a golden heart whom has a penchant for showering strangers with encouraging words and making a difference in the world as we know it.\n\nWhile his large azure eyes often appear lost, they always light up with welcoming glee in most situations, being a recognizable feature upon a masked face that always tends to remain a mystery to many alive. The fortunate few who may have been granted the opportunity to see his beloved scarf anywhere else but on his features can determine that his visage is unscathed and considerably soft in appearance which might make one wonder what the cause for concealment is. His horns are arched forward and rather similar to those of an ox, which are without cracks or malformations and stand out rather well.\n\nWoven together are stark tresses of white that drop down in waves of silken strands that are well maintained, which have a habit of becoming unruly after a prolonged while of activity. The tail has few locks that tend to escape the containment of the tail, separating themselves and running freely down his shoulders instead. The remainder of hair flows down in long strands, with some being shorter than others in comparison, but still being tamed in a casual manner. One could detect the vague floral scent that had seeped into his hair, occasionally indulging himself in products that make the mane less tainted by the harsh circumstances of the outside world.\n\nLike many of his ilk, he has witnessed gruesome ordeals that have shaped him through the years, having trained himself on from a very early age and having maintained his ideal physique which makes him unequivocally a formidable foe that is likely to end a battle within seconds. His pale body displays a sufficient amount of muscles which makes it relatively impressive, but has not exceeded the limit, which gave him plenty of agility that he combines with deadly strikes and arcane magic that can quickly turn the tide in battle. His hooves are reinforced with layers of armor and serve as protection and as a weapon simultaneously, much like his tail which is broad at its base but turns out to be extremely long and thinner at its end.\n\nRunes are the most unique trait as they cover nearly every inch of his body, littering his white skin in colorful symbols that all have different shapes, sizes and purposes, but all luminously glow despite their locations. An intelligent mind can quickly conclude that his lack of clothing coincides with the runes, forming an obstacle for the runes which often results in tragic consequences. Those familiar with the use of magic can most certainly feel the arcane aura he emanates, which is quite strong, but not as potent as that of a full-fledged mage.",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

A narrow mouth with lips that pout a little, the corners angled down, and eyebrows that sit a little high all contribute to the impression that she's always looking down on you, disappointed and unsure what to do with you. She radiates condescension, even when she does not at all mean it. Call it a resting bitch face, or a manifestation of her subconcious lack of fucks to give, it all depends on how poetic you're feeling.\n\nHer face has a round shape to it, with wide cheekbones and a narrow chin, rounded cheeks and a medium-width jawline. A short but wide nose caps it off, all framed in by dark blonde hair she usually puts up in a thick ponytail. She is also not a small woman exactly. She is tall, a lot of which is in her long legs, and as she spends most of her day pouring over books, her bon-vivant lifestyle shows on her hips a little. She has the classic hourglass shape, as her body tapers off briefly around her waist before widening again over her upper torso. *That* one can't be anything but a pact with a demon...{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h2}{col:a3ff28}The girl{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}{col:d8d8d8}Ceredwyn began her life as the daughter of an estate owner, noble by no means but wealthier than most who actually had to work the fields. Her mother was a harverst witch, or so some would refer to her as anyway, most Alliance citizens use the term druid. \n\nYoung Ceredwyn was of course expected to follow in her mother's footsteps. The Glenor family was know for caring for the men and women who worked their wine fields, to commune with the wild and verdant spirits of the fields and forests for this purpose. Theirs is an old tradition which shines through in the old names they tend to be called, names that since long fell out of fashion on merry old Gilneas.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{h2}{col:00e912}The woman{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}{col:d8d8d8}She would, however, soon reveal an affinity for a much more unsettling sort of communion. After the first few lessions when her connection with nature's spirits was tested, she started waking at night after exhausing dreams where she spoke with demons. She produced miniscule magical effects when in the presence of recently-deceased animals, and left dead plants in her wake during her rare fits of anger. Her talents were identified after the worried parents hired the talents of a passing missionary from Stormwind, and she was promptly sent to training in Gilneas city into the demonologist she is today.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h2}{col:9a37ff}The researcher{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}{col:d8d8d8}Finding acceptance but little enthusiasm within the confines of Gileans's walls, Ceredwyn soon decided she needed to leave. She would be one of few fortunate souls to depart the country mere weeks before the Forsaken assault struck her homeland. But she met the news of the invasion with stoicism, having precious little nostalgia for a country she thought to be close-minded and conservative. \n\nShe continued on to fairer shores, and eventually found herself doing her demonology research in Stormwind city, ever under the equally stoic gaze of the Cathedral of the Holy light. Always seeking to satiate her voracious appetite for knowledge, she also began studying physiology and medicine, which brought her only experience of war to date when she was drafted into the Alliance armies as a nurse during the Fourth war. She has since used these two vocations combined to study the physiological effects of Fel corruption on the body, an ongoing research topic for her.{/col}{/h3}\n",

Eventually she took up teaching other mages, however eventually she decided to explore the world. That lead her to visit the Underground city of Gnomeregan. She went there before the whole situation, and left before it happened. During her lifeime, Lurizz has particapated in multiple conflicts. Besides that she also took up on mercenary-esque work, keeping herself busy while also making a good living. Eventually she joined an organization of demon hunters called the \"Nethergaze Converegence\". It did not last that long, however, as eventually it fell apart due to lack of funds. After being nearly driven insane by a strange crystal as well as almost killed, she sought to live a peaceful life. Allthough, that was not long lived as she was recruited by the \"Assemblage of Uld\", where she has been employed for almost a year up to this point.\n",

Her clothes are clean, pressed and carefully cladding her frame. Boots polished and armour well tended to, you'd be hard to find an unwanted mark about her person. Careful creases moulded into cloth with a military precision that is only acquired by force of habit.\n\nShoulders almost always straight and thrown back, she carries herself carefully and with impeccable posture.\n\nStanding at five feet and eight inches, Lister is not a particularly small woman, nor is she necessarily imposing. Her hands are however dainty and untelling of her trade.\n\nHardly ever without one of her two swords, Harry and Holloway. One little and one large, but never wielding both simultaneously.\n\nOften opting to brush and tie her hair up neatly with no additional or uneccessary fuss,  it sticks out like a sore thumb. Bright auburn in hue and unusually wild, a beast that she has never quite mastered taming.\n\nWhen on show, strange markings can be seen on her neck, wrists and ankles. Black imprints in the shapes of crow's feet trail from the nape of her neck, plunging downwards to the bottom of her chest. Ankles and wrists 'shackled' with a litter of inky arrows on her skin, linking around loosely to form full yet imperfect circles.\n\nAlthough reserved and restrained for the better part, Lister is the proud owner of a friendly and jovial face and the first to crack a smile when the mood is low. Her accent is jumbled and hard to pinpoint, some tones within seeming to be practiced and somewhat forced. However, hints of Arathi can be detected from her fluid tones. \n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/570389483938381824/572753515181768715/image0.jpg*Lister.}",

As is customary with the majority of Illidari, she also has a series of intricate tattoos across her torso and arms.\n\nA large pair of leathery, bat-like wings jut out from just between her shoulder-blades. They're just dextrous enough that she can wrap them around her shoulders, not unlike a cloak. She can also give great hugs with them, assuming she likes someone enough to do so...\n\nEquipment-wise, her various outfits have been modified in a few ways. The majority of her shirts have been altered to allow her wings to fit through them. Meanwhile, her other equipment has various little tinkerings and additions. Things like small gadgets, pouches for useful items and snacks, and the occasional spinny things, just because she likes to fiddle with them.{/col}",

At times of high stress, she can become fairly irritable, preferring to wander off alone and come back when she is calmer, if possible. She is also prone to making rash decisions, which is how she became a Demon Hunter in the first place.\n\nDue to the Burning of Teldrassil, Séitharan has begun to exhibit symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; Having visited the World Tree a week before hand, and noting how similar it was to her old home, seeing it burn down around her forced her to revisit those memories.",

Distraught and overcome with grief, Séitharan heard news of a group that would be taking vengeance upon those who had wrought such distruction. And so, she chose to seek out the Illidari on Outland, and become a Demon Hunter.\n\nHer training under the Illidari was brutal, punishing and, at times, highly destructive. When the time came to bond with a demon, Séitharan was given a Mo'arg Felguard, named S'kith. The battle was fierce, but Séitharan arose the victor. After the bonding process, S'kith had been relegated a voice in the back of her mind, a constant reminder of the Burning Legion's presence.\n\nAfter the release of the Illidari from the Vault of the Wardens, Séitharan wandered the world, in search of signs of the Legion, should they have slipped away from the Broken Isles. To that end, she took a job with the Trader's Association as security for a period of time, before leaving due to not having the right \"mobility to search.\"\n\nAfter returning to Azeroth from Argus, Séitharan has spent plenty of time as both a loner, and a member of various groups, while trying to make herself feel useful.",

This dream however, came into conflict with her personal values. Teya felt that Garrosh Hellscream was too barbaric, and after hearing the horrific events of the bombing of Theramore, she felt she was at odds with the Horde, and after a battle with an unruly Garrosh apologist, Teya left her home in Orgrimmar.\n\nTeya's life became very nomadic, exploring all the corners of the isle of Kalimdor, training against whoever offered a duel. Her life became solely focused on her training, rarely taking reprieve in the beautiful scenery, hearing the tyranny of Garrosh occasionally from the citizens of the towns she passed through, fuelling her rage, and increasing the harshness of her self imposed training.\n\nReturning to Orgrimmar months later to the mistreatment of Trolls and the slavery of Tauren, Teya looked for any signs of resistance against the Orcish supremacy regime, and found plenty of it. Joining ranks with the likes of Lorthemar Theron and Vol'jin, as well as the Alliance in the siege of Orgrimmar, Teya fought against the Iron Juggernaut, and after a long battle, met her death against the might of the great machine.\n\nAfter dying to the Iron Juggernaut, Teya found herself alive once more, at her grave. Lost for words, being greeted by an undead General Nazgrim, offering Teya another chance at life as a knight of the Ebon Blade. Teya accepted and swore fealty to the Lich King, grateful for her one more shot at life, after it was cruelly taken away by the Orcish Horde. ",

Her adoptive family were not so welcoming towards her which made her make the wrong decisions. At a very young age she choose the path of theft and later joined to a pirate crew. She spent most of her time there, later she became a student of the Jade Seprent and learned this and that of the path of the White Tiger.

Her pointy ears are poking out of her hair. She is not about to hide them. If someone  does not fancy her then she will just simply ignore the person. Her father was a Quel'Dorei noble, while her mother was a Lordaeronian Royal guard. They met one day in the city and fell in love pretty quickly. The Titans soon blessed the mother with Aionah. Tho everything was happy the parents sadly passed away during the scourge invasion leaving the little Aionah alone. The only thing she has from her family is her name and her status which she is not using for obvious reasons.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:0032ff}The Sailing Serpent{/col}{/h1}\n{p:c}{col:0032ff}The Sailing Serpent were the pirate crew who ,,adopted'' the young Aionah.

Came to Azeroth along with other orcs back during First war. Because of a certain incident, before Orgrim Doomhammer's rise to power, he fled the Horde to live as a Hermit travelling across Azeroth. Rejoined the Horde during the founding of Orgrimmar after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits.\n\nConsidered more gentle and cosiderate than most orcs, Still values Honor and strenght. His wolf is always somewhere nearby.\nWidower with sons all over the place.\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nKoruz became part of the leadership of Darkheart company. Nearing the end of the last campaign he died attempting to save his friends. Recently came back after journeying through Shadowlands.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2}{icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is an Older orc, a fact that isnt reflected in his appearance, betrayed only by the silver color of his hair. said hair is lenghty, tied into various braids, and a ponytail to ensure it won't be a problem in combat. his beard is also quite long, and braided aswell. His physique is quite impressive on it's own, even for an orc, without even mentioning his age, leaving the wonder of how he looked when he was younger. various scars adorn his body, left by anything starting from beasts, through enemy warriors, and otherwordly creatures. his body is also adorned in tatoo's, which on first glance look like typical Burning blade marks, but in fact serve as runes, that are able to protect Koruz from harmfull magical effects of magics, with void and light magic remaining exception, which although still slightly protected from, remains quite vulnerable to. his expressions tend to be a bit dimmed down, remaining mostly calm in all situations.\n\n{h2:c}Equipment{/h2}{icon:spell_warrior_sharpenblade:25}\n\nKoruz's equipment is mostly simply, resembling a typical blademaster's attire. fine quality leather gloves with bronze vembraces, long kilt woven from strong thread with few steel plates attached, and a double belt with sacks attached to hold it up. Padded leather belts crossing on his chest and tied around his biceps for a bit of extra protection, but mainly because of the pouches on said belts for exttra carry space. otherwise he wears no chestplate as to not limit his movements, spare cloth bandages covering parts of his chest and arms, for unknown reasons. His boots are also made from strong leather, with steel tips and few spikes. His most prized possesion is his blade, that to many remains mystery. Most often his blade look quite simplistic, it's long and slick, but still tough and sturdy. It widens at the end with a ring being attached at the end containing various trophies and trinkets. what is unusual about it is it's blue glow, and slightly colder and spiritual aura.\nAfter coming back from his unfortunate journey through shadowlands, his blade now shifts between that and the other apperance. That other appearance looks like a runeblade, similarly built to the other one, with it's tip resembling a guillotine. adorned with various runes, and a skull with dark steel plates. the blade emanates a sickly green aura that seeps around like a miasma. Those who look upon that blade tend to feel unnatural fear, and those of stronger spirit feel discomfort.\n",

Some treated the boy with respect while some didn’t.\n\nAt 25 years, Sun was wounded by a Hozan chieftain but was saved by his son Xain who in turn killed the Chieftain with his father's sword. After this, Sun retired from being the Captain and settled down with his son.\nThree months later Jinjing was permitted to leave the household as often as she wanted to support her family.\n\nAt 28 years, Xian convinces his parents to let him go with the other Islanders to visit the world. His father, not trusting outsiders, was hesitant  at first, but agreed,  but his mother protested only to agree when she couldn't convince  Sun otherwise. \n\nWith a Hug from his father and a kiss from his mother he left with the rest of the pandaren for the eastern kingdoms.\n{/p}\n",

She sought to, but not always succeeded in being a calm individual, hoping to defuse situations rather than add to their violence - although prepared to use her means should she need to. Being a wielder of the light, she could mend those who needed it - and could use her skills offensively as well, should the situation call for it.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-paladin-cover:128:128}\n\n\nMitford's head was crowned with her blonde hair, typically cut to a short to medium length, or put into a bun during times of war. The Paladin's cheeks had a small hint of red on otherwise relatively pale skin, her blue eyes shone out and lips delicate and pursed. Her cheek had a soft tissue scar, which was whiter than the rest of her skin.\n\nHer body was well toned and trained, effort no doubt invested into herself. She was strong for her size, able to fight and protect those near and dear. On top of her frame rested her blue and gold platemail armour, her personal and prime property. She kept it clean and maintained. Around her belt was kept a small knife as well as her strong and stable shield. She also, when within the city, carried a rapier - when on duty in the field, she typically used an arming sword.\n\n{img:Interface\\Calendar\\UI-Calendar-Event-PVP02:64:64}\n\nThis is a new character and thus is still a work in progress. I am new to Paladin RP - If I make a mistake, feel free to correct me, please also do so if there's any errors here in regards to spelling! Thank you. <3\n",

The story goes:{/col}\n\n(Music to go with the story if you choose to listen to it while reading: The Troupe Master (Grimm + Nightmare King) )\n\n\"You see, i met my husband many years ago. \nIt seems like a century by now, but it was only fifteen years ago. He was a lumberjack, working in Elwynn forest. \nWe had a lovely house, and soon after we met i got pregnant. \nRosie was born in a sunny spring day. But sadly. She was born with a health decease. When we got news of it, my husband and i was devastated. \nI knew what would happen with Rosie. And i would have giving everything to change that outcome. \nUnforturnately that oppotunity came one dreadful night. \nI was on my way home with Rosie from Goldshire when i ran into a tall disguised man. \nHe asked the way to Stormwind and after i explained it, he looked at my sweet little baby and asked what was wrong with her. \ni explained that she was birthed with a heart decease and that she would soon die. \nHe in turn, explained that we was a holy man from the church of light and that he could maybe treat her. \nI knew it was too good to believe but i was desperate. \nI had nothing to lose but much to gain, so i...\nI should never had giving him permission. When we arrived home, my husband wasn´t there so i assumed he was out gathering wood as he have done many times before. \nI invited the man inside so he could see Rosie. And of course, he did. After a while he said he would make a prayer for her and try to nurish her back to health.\nI gladly accepted it. Without even thinking twice. I.. Don´t know what had happened, but when i woke up from the chair i had falled asleep in, who knows how long i had slept.\nI was so tired and exhausted from her continuing crying and me desperately searching for a way to undo the future for my little Rosie. \nI knew something was wrong. I had this dreadfull feeling inside of my heart.. Something was not right.\nI rushed inside my babies bedroom and there.. I knew my husband had painted the room green as the forest. What awaited me inside that place. Was the paint of anything but green. the air was thick with the smell of death and decease. \ni could hear hidden whispers from every corner of the room. And i knew there was things in the shadows, trying to reach out for me, to rip and tear me apart. The man was of cours gone. I ran, and i ran until my legs was hurting so bad and my lungs couldn´t keep a single gasp of air inside. \nThere, on the riverbed i fell with eyes red with tears. \nI looked into the water and all i saw was the mans face.. looking at me and laughing menacing at me. what had i done to deserve such a fate?. What had i done to my poor baby?. \nI guess i never will know. I never saw my husband again either. And i never returned to that house. \nI later got told it had burned down but i didn´t care. I wanted my baby back.\n\nAfter many years, i learned about this gift as i call it. And i learned its wonders. What things i could imagine to do. I swore i would avenge my baby, i swore i would hunt that man down even if it costed me my life, so i swore an alliegence with a warlock i met. He gave me the strength and knowledge to continue. \nOne day he offered me this stone i now have around my neck. he told me it could store any souls with a special ritual, and i knew exactly which soul i wanted.\nHeh, i didn´t even think twice about the consequences or how evil an act that was. i just knew that i could have my baby back in some way. A twisted way, but a way non the less. \nI accepted without caring. i had grown cold, and lonely at this point. \nI just wanted the pain from the memories to subside. And so, we began. \nOh i still recalls the horrible.. Horrible cries from Rosie.. You see, when you store a soul unwillingly into a gemstone of this sort. \nYou get to relive all the memories up until their death. Had i known that i would never had done it. But i couldn´t stop. The cries.. the mans voice, the whispers..\n\ni could hear and sense everything Rosie had went through that horrible night. But i knew my goal, and i knew if i stopped now, her soul would be gone forever into the void. and from that moment off, i have always had her necklage around my neck.\n\n{col:8c142a}So, you see dear. As the story comes to an end. I am left wondering. Am i still a good mother.. or a cruel demoness?.\"{/col}",

Everything looked good for young Kirdeak but everything turned, when he met a strange man out in the forest. By accident, Kirdeak had cut down a tree that fell on this stranger. The strange man cast a curse on him. Now he could at random turn to a werewolf and when his parents sadly saw this, wasn't he welcomed to return home.\n\nKirdeak in his teen years grew up on the streets of Gilneas, catching and eating rats and garbage and in Northgate woods, hunting deer’s and eating berries. (lived mostly in Northgate) \nIt wasn’t until his early twenties that new problems rose up. When a hunter from Stormwind was on a hunting expedition to Northgate woods he found the turned Kirdeak sleeping in the bushes. He captured Kirdeak and took him back to the hunter's home in Stormwind where he was imprisoned for having the werewolf curse and was showed as an entertainment animal for spectators.\n\nIt was not until two years later that a merchant from Gilneas came by and was interested in buying Kirdeak and bringing him back to Gilneas, to still be seen as entertainment for spectators. But Kirdeak liked to be a prisoner, because he no longer had to think about food and protection, he got everything he needed from the merchant now.\n\nWeeks passed until the merchant suddenly passed away by poisoning, in fear of getting blamed for being the killer, Kirdeak fled into the woods to never return again until after the fall of Gilneas.  \n\nAfter returning after years of living in the wilds to Stormwind, Kirdeak has to a minimal degree interacted with others, so to his return to Stormwind he doesn’t know how to proper talk to the folks in town. When citizens trying to interact with him, he doesn't know what to do, for most of the times does he simply take off and run to a less crowded place.    \n{col:d3c7ff}{/col}",

A lenient, curious look seemed perpetually at play in her sapphire eyes. Her complexion spoke little of the life she’d caught in constant seabreeze led - yet a toned and nimble, but visibly strong body did in its stead. \nShe stood firm on land, clad in rare leathers and adorned with a multitude of silver piercings in each ear to name a few. Eira, like most from Kul’Tiras these days, seemed more at home in the distant capital of Stormwind than before. Then again, the careful gait after sunrise and blades still sheathed by her side were a recurring sight still. \nApart from a love for great cuisine and odd playful activities she enjoyed the occasional trip outside into the world to quell a still quenchless curiousity. All in all, she is a rather unpredictable and earnest young woman who doesn’t seem to mind speaking her mind.\n\n\n\nReference image: https://tinyurl.com/EiraReferenceImg\n{/col}{/p}\n",

He wanted to have action, adventures! He wanted to be a warrior.\n\nHis father and mother not blind to boy’s interests and lovingly accepting his choices, agreed to inlist him into a Paladin training.\n\nJasper has plenty of dedication and talent.\nPerhaps being surrounded by the Light all his life made his connection stronger. Easier to harness its power for righteous cause.\n\nExcept the Light wasn’t boys only interest. He also loved his combat training. Nothing made him happier than a sword practice.\n\nJasper has plenty of courage when wielding his blade, however he becomes very nervous when interacting with others often masking it with well meaning humour.\n\n{/col}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{/col}{h3:c}{col:30e6ff}{/col}Character Summary{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}\nJasper is young human lad, barely tasted “the real life”.  He’s eager to learn and study and fight for what he considers righteous cause.\n\nDespite his stoic personality he does have normal human emotions and shows anger as every one else. It does take a lot to bring it out and even more to make him violent without what he would consider “a good reason”. \n\nHe is usually kind and caring, but he can also be tough if situation requires such. \n\nFor all the flaws that the boy has one stands out the most. That is his first language: sacrasm, and his wicked sense of humor.\n\nHe’s still exploring himself as a person and the possibilities that his training will provide.\n{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h3:c}{col:30e6ff}{/col}Appearance{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}\nBlonde slightly wavy hair, looking a little messy. He smiles easily and with warmth in his eyes, which are filled with young mans curiosity. \n\nFor his (or others) protection he almost always wears full amour, which at this point feels like second skin to him. For same reasons he would usually carry a simple looking sword.\n\nHe isn’t exactly muscular, but he isn’t weedy-looking either. There is an air of hidden strength about him that transpires in his balance, the way he holds himself, the way he talks. His voice is soft and calm most of the time.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h3:c}{col:30e6ff}{/col}Additional Information{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}\n\nVisual Representation (From Artbreeder)\n{link*https://photos.app.goo.gl/6rygBHtFUNkLFDMB6*Jasper Aston}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n",

He generally seems like a nice man who has traveled far and wide.. His height is 6.5ft.\n\nThe whole right side of his chest he has a purple burn mark that almost covers he hole right side chest.\nEven some smaller cut scars too as well as a arcane burn mark on his arm.\nOn the back of his shoulder he has whip marks obviously from being tortured and goes to show that he has endured quite a lot of physical pain in the past.\n\n\nJohn can socially awkward at times. He doesn't really say much, he is usually a rather quiet man. Instead he would often be seen with some of his animal companions, namely Nilrem, Sir Eggs and his dog Bobby. But of course he loves more being together with his with his beloved family and wife Cethera.\n\nHe is a loyal man who keeps his vows, no matter whom they may be to. Lying is not in his nature, neither would he be particularly good at it even if he attempted it. He is always honest and truthful.\n\nHe mostly only smokes or drinks when he is a really down mood. He drinks to try to forget. \nHe can seem real stubborn sometimes, or his choices might seem real harsh or strict. But evrything he do is always because he belive its the right choice.\n\n\n{h1:c}Beard{/h1}\n\nWhen you look at John beard it clearly notice that he takes care of his beard as well washed it quite often not wanting to keep it dirty. The beard it´s long and thick and neathly groomed. Its usually trimmed on the sides to keep the same level on it. His beard has never been fully shaved since he was twenty one. When he trim his beard he never goes more than just one inch. He cares much about his beard like any Dwarf would.\n\n\n\n{h1:c}The Red Gryphons {/h1}\n\nIt is a small order of Gryphon riders. Being created by John L Chester who is it leader. Leading a neutral order which its only cause is to fight for others, to the point they will risk their own life to save others.\n\nThe Red Gryphons is always looking for capable people who can fight and heal, for those who wish to help others, to travel around world and go to the most dangerous places to fight and protect others. Accepting payment from others is something the Gryphons don't accept. But for those who needs payment is something they will receive for their work with in the Red Gryphons. \n\nThe order out fit is very simple. Is to wear the crest on their chest as well with dark color armor that suits with the Red Gryphons crest. As well they accept any race to join the Gryphons.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(OOC stuff about the guild). Hello! The Red Gryphons are a relative small guild, And will mostly prefer to remain a small guild. We do not do massive recruitment. We prefer to recruit a few people at the time and build up a nice community for everyone with in the guild. The Red Gryphons is a fighting guild yet we do story times events, social and much more but fighting is the main goal. \n\nWe do not accept any kind of drama with in the guild, unless its IC drama. Any kind of drama thats gets dragged between IC and OOC we will ignore it as its not fun RP in that case.\n\nOur general goal is to have fun to RP and have fun doing activites together. We prefer to be a chill guild and not stress things over.\n\nWe are very friendly to new Roleplayers who wants to join us and learn how to RP.We welcome anyone new RP and experience\n\n\n\n\n",

As you look at her for the first time her whole bodylanguage is a meek puppy. She seems skittish and jumpy. For every loud noise you see her quickly look in the direction wence it came. She also seems to be fidgeting with her hands alot.\n\n\n\n{h1}Physical Appearance{/h1}\nShe's not beautiful. Some might consider the plainness of her an appealing attribute but you won't be seeing her on any pin-up calendars ever. \n\nHer face lacks any make-up whatsoever. The skin around her eyes are a darker hue of green than the rest of her face. A few freckles can be found below her eyes. She has a rather small nose for a goblin but has the usual full lips. \n\nA few nothces can be found at her ears. One bit that was torn off, a few snips here and there, but Dotty still wears earrings of all sorts. \n\nHer body is average as well. It has some decent proportions sure and she has a bit of a belly on her. It's mostly covered up in clothes so nothing really stands out about that part of her. \n\nIf you ever were to see her without a shirt on, and, why would you? You would see tattoos inked onto her skin from shoulder to navel. An intricate pattern of which the origin is known only to Dotty and perhaps the person who actually tatood it. \n\n\n\n\n",

Her accent pegs her as having originally grown up in the Southern Eastern Kingdoms, and she's particularly at ease around gnomes.\n\nHer left arm is plainly mechanical, a highly advanced prosthetic. Gears and actuators move visibly in the forearm, finally merging into a double pair of metal rings that joins her flesh and blood upper arm at mid bicep.\n\nHer clothes are often a little tatty, and rarely more formal than a loose shirt and trousers. She carries a complicated mechanical hammer at her belt, hand shifting closer to it when she feels threatened.\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/47176*AA page with art}",

The rare colored pink eyes that always have a twinkle in them in combination with her soft and always noticeable smile on the crimson red lips is not a rare sight on her, the pink-white mixed hair was probably not such a common sight but still form a kind of cute overall expression.{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ff71a6}\"People cry not because they're weak, it's because they've been strong for such a long time.\"{/col}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:420:44}\n\n{h3} {col:d596ff}{icon:achievement_zone_wetlands_01:25} History {icon:achievement_zone_wetlands_01:25}{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h3}{col:a341ff}Miranda was born in Menethil Harbor located in Wetlands, about twenty years ago inside of a small house within the small town, she was healthy since birth and proofed to life a life void of any particular issues. During her younger years she desperately wanted to explore the world, yet unfortunately only managed to be within the harbor since she was being told the world was a dangerous place although it didn't last that long hence because of the father passed away which lead to miranda's mother and her had to travel to the capital of Stormwind to live with miranda's auntie there. Years has passed dreaming about the near and distant future her teenage years presented themself, where she'd attend the local school much like the common city folks of Stormwind. It was within these years she has met many great people, yet one who unbeknowst to her would greatly affect her path in life. Alongside the roads did she meet a pandaren traveller who she accompany with for a period of time, it turned out the traveller was one of the teacher at a monastery back in Pandaria and upon the offer of becoming a student there to which Miranda accepted. She stayed there for a couple of months there she was taught various of things of life before she departed to go back to Stormwind there the story took another path..{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Blizzard:512:8}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In fact, his scientific studies and high proficiency as a mage are clear indicators that he is one very smart fox, even though he seldom shows or admits it. He believes that one of the greatest gifts one can possess is to be underestimated.\n\nHis studies often have him travelling vast distances across Azeroth, and sometimes even beyond. Therefore, he generally stays alone so he can devote himself to his studies without having other responsibilities on the side.\nHe has small observatories or hidden equipment placed in many spots all across Azeroth. These help him measure important readings that contribute to his research. Therefore, it is not uncommon for him to appear in places where a Vulpera usually wouldn't be.\n\nAs for magic, he mostly focuses on the arcane schools of pyromancy, astromancy, divination, telemancy, illusion and transmutation.\n\nNext to his studies of the universe and magical arts, Ayli is also a zoologist. Although much less proficient at zoology than astronomy and magic, he is still quite good at it! And he often shows how much he loves and cares about animals and nature.",

But in the end - there is but one inevitable change that comes for anyone that meddles with its power, no matter in which manner one does it.\n\nFor Ashivari, its chaotic influence has made itself more than apparent. She is taller than most elves, standing a little taller than the average night elf male with a muscularity that's rare among her kin. \n\nBy definition, it'd be easy to say that she's ripped, with thick, skin-straining muscles along her shoulders and biceps down to her unusually thick wrists which are coated with thick demonic scales and a hardened surface almost reminding one of rock, at least by appearance. By the end of her quite demonic fingers are 3-inched claws. \n\nHer remaining body remains as rippled with muscle as the rest, her abdomen sporting an eight-pack straining against her hardened, dark-grey skin that seems to be another side-effect of her corruption. Her thighs are thick with muscle, looking like they might be able to crush a head between them if she desired to. Her calves and ankles aren't any less muscular because of it, however. Her feet sports 1.5-inched claws where there clearly has been nails before.\n\nWhether it's a side effect to her corruption or because of some other reason - it appears her fat distribution has been delivered to her voluptuous feminine forms that shape themselves along her muscular body, forming heavy-set, rounded shapes in the right areas.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\nVarious corrupting features reveals themselves upon her body. Horns being the most obvious ones as they're grown out of her head to curve up and backwards. Interestingly, in the ridges along the horns there seems to be some kind of magical ink that lits up every once in a while, probably when Ashivari desires it to be so.\n\nOn the note of magical ink - the tattooes lingering along Ashivari's body are quite thick, as if they've been added to more than once.\n\nOn her upper back upon her shoulderwings, there's a rather curious growth added to her. While protruding about 2-3 inches outwards, the surface seems to be made of that strange \"rock-like\" surface, with a center protruding more than the rest, kind of like two volcanoes on her back - because the center part seems to have two holes in them, almost like short tubes. It is from these growths that the demon huntress appears to be \"growing\" her large, leathery bat-like wings from.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\n{col:68ff00}Facially, the demon huntress seems to have retained much of her elven origin, except for a few scaled growths around her temples, cheekbones and lower forehead. Her luscious lips seem to have gained a rather crimson colour to it with a particular darker shade to it, but between them -  her teeth seems to have been replaced with a row of sharp fangs, with her elven canines being longer than the rest - evidently giving her speeches and grins a more monstrous appearance about it.\n\nUnusual among elves, her hair seems to have grown blackened by her corruption - although one could argue that it isn't necessarily a disastrous change. \nEvidently having been a beauty in the past - it now remains (even more so) in the eyes of the beholder whether she still is or not.\n\nA blindfold almost always covers her eyes. But if for some reason she'd be without it - her eye sockets appear be scorched out, with nothing but felflames filling them. At least, that's what it'd look like - whether or not it's actually felflames.\n\nHer ears are usually adorned with felslate plates, much in the same fashion that certain Nightborne appear to adorn their ears with such things.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\nHer voice is as warped by fel energy as the rest of her body. As she speaks - her voice echoes slightly with a hum of power, which powerful beings usually get for whatever reason. Whether this is a sign of whether or not Ashivari is powerful or simply because of her corruption could be a matter of debate - but is clear is that it echoes. Despite her corrupted voice, however, she clearly possess some form of charisma in the way she speaks, even if her tone may sometimes be stoic or nonchalant, depending on who she's speaking with.\n\nRegardless of armour, she usually carries two clearly demonic daggers in strangely styled sheaths on her belt or otherwise elsewhere on her armour. She also bears two glaive handles on her sides, whether attached to her belt or not. She may be carrying other things upon her belt, like vials or a satchel, from time to time.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-demonhunter-cover:256:256}\n\n\n\n",

Striking blue eyes and perfectly plush lips jostle for attention, harmoniously accented by a petite nose and slim eyebrows.\n\nHer impressively fit and well formed physique is a head turning sort, the otherworldly beauty of her kind refined through hardship and the rigors of an active life. A slim neck leads down to a modest chest, toned abdominal muscles and well sculpted arms that end in hands toughened from manual work. The pear-like silhouette defining shape of her hips leads down to dangerously powerful thighs, hiking ready calves and hooves that promise to deliver disorienting kicks!\n\nAn alchemist turned intrepid adventurer, Mixalia’s choice of attire is far from ostentatious. Robust and trim clothing fit for travel in a variety of climates and outfitted with all sorts of pockets and pouches. She tends towards earthy shades and often wears a moss green tabard dedicated to the city of Shattrath that’s associated with the sanctuary’s lower city and its residence. Iconography that’s both a sombre reminder and symbolic of the hope and respite Shattrath offered so many.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h2:c}{col:DE5E3E}Public Information{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-BurntEarth:512:4}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}With much of her professional life having been dedicated to the study of alchemy, it’s common knowledge that she creates and sells all manner of both common and rare potions, balms and tinctures!\n\nAn empathetic sort, Mixalia is known to have provided relief and assistance to the innumerable refugees that flocked to Shattrath City in the wake of Outland’s world bending collapse. She also provided similar help to those who fled Teldrassil for Stormwind following its destruction.\n\nTumultuous decades required many Draenei, including Mixalia, to learn how to defend themselves. She's alleged to be competent!{/col}{/p}\n",

He sadly got send away because he didn't posses enough power. Feeling useless, he started to travel, coming across the ways of the Void. Tirx made there and then the vow, to protect the loved ones in his life, and for that purpose gain more power. There for he isn't as much affected by whispers as others from his Kin.\n\nSadly, because he choose this path, he got exiled from the Sin'dorei, effectively becoming a full Ren'dorei. Proud of what his believes are, He aims to protect the ones he holds dear.\n\n{h2:c}Currently{/h2}\n\nAfter being cast out from Quel'thalas, Tirx started to roam. When he found himself half dead in Stormwind, he was saved by a warrior named Richard Crowder. This man is to this day, still his friend. He joined up with House Caine, and became a proud magus for them. After the disbandment of House Caine, he traveled a bit more, eventually joining up with a few other orders, but none felt like home to him.\n\n Until he found the Cerulean Aegis. The order was warm and open to him, treating him like family. Tirx was really uncertain about this at the time. He was happy to be in their service, and was sad when the Aegis sadly disbanded too.\n\nAfter that, he came in service of Lady Sevestra Hawke, and was appointed as her knight. Though after a while, she disappeared, without a trace. Feeling like his knighthood didn't serve any purpose anymore, he decided to find a new job.\n\nHe found work in the Azure Claw, looking forward to meet all the new people in this small family.\n\nAfter a short period of time, he decided to pledge himself to lady Zithis Shadowweb as her knight. Keeping her safe from harm.\n\nTirxus pledged himself to the cause of Doctor Samantha Lightspark and the Ellerian Medical Centre. He helps them out when ever they need.\n\nAfter a while, He decided it's been enough for a while and left the Azure Claw, laid down his tasks as a knight and went out into the world. Traveling from area to area,trying to stay out of trouble. Though the call back to Stormwind remained, he returned after a few months of traveling. \n\nHe laid down his responsibilties as the Knight of Lady Zithis, but found a new calling to become the new Knight of the Arbor, under Reina Redwyne.\n\n{h2:c}Personality{/h2}\nAs his personality goes, Tirx is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. He does come across very charming and flirty, sometimes bringing him into trouble. Tirx mostly sports a boyish grin on his face, which makes him try to see things on the brightside instead of always being serious. How ever, do not touch the ones he loves, because he will do everything in his power to hunt that person down.\n\nOverall, he is a very caring and sensitive guy. Fiercely loyal, to his friends and will always worry about them instead about himself. He's not a typical Ren'dorei, though he might come across cocky during hardfought battles. \nHow ever, he is not a power hungry being, and only uses his strength to protect, rather then to harm without reason.\n\n{h2:c}People who are close to him{/h2}\n\nNorlina Van Het Veld\nVelonara Darkstrider\nIllisandra Nightinggale\nPetra Sandcog\nCayleia Heartveil\nZackery Tallandor\nFayeliel Umbralstrider\nRen'Thalir Shadowblade (half brother)\nAlithael Runedawn\nLady Elizabeth T.

This led to a rough upbriging in Stormwind, the city providing little shelter for the family as they relocated. Though, through hardships and persistence the woman was raised with decent knowledge and skills that allowed her to make a living for herself once she was at a reasonable age. Due to some certain elements in her life, she's been able to pick up a few valuable interests, her marksmanship strong along with other handy proficiencies, and to this day she still seeks to learn more - often hitting the libraries and questioning people in order to do so.\n\nPresently, she's taking contracts that'll help with her income as well as her skills, the Ranger helping out wherever she can and however she can.\n{h3:c}{col:f7f9ff}{/col}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sandstorm:700:7}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffedcc}• Appearance •{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3:c}{col:f7f9ff}{link*https://i.imgur.com/yXSC1s0.jpg*Portrait}{/col}{/h3}\n{h3:c}{col:f7f9ff}{link*https://i.imgur.com/5343ooY.jpg*Armour and weapons}{/col}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sandstorm:700:7}\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffedcc}• Skills of Combat •{/col}{/h2}\n\n{p}{col:f7f9ff}{icon:inv_weapon_bow_09:25} • Bows and Crossbows: Master{/col}\n{col:f7f9ff}{icon:inv_firearm_2h_rifle_draenorcrafted_d_01_a_horde:25} • Rifles: Master{/col}\n{col:f7f9ff}{icon:inv_sword_1h_draenorcrafted_d_02_a_horde:25}  • Swords: Expert{/col}\n{col:f7f9ff}{icon:trade_archaeology_rustedsteakknife:25}  • Daggers: Proficient{/col}\n\n\n{col:f7f9ff}{icon:ability_xaril_masterpoisoner_red:25} • Poison and Toxins: Expert{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:b9b9b9}• Additional Information •{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3:c}{col:f7f9ff}Website: {link*https://tirilart.wixsite.com/mysite*•}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-hunter-thasdorah:512:200}\n",

His body well traveled but otherwise somewhat neglected, devoid of trained muscles and little fat as he has a woefully average if not slightly lanky build. His raven black hair reaches down to his neck, well taken care of but otherwise unkempt as loose strands trail down the sides of his face. It certainly looks like it’d be annoying, but he seems to pay it little mind. His beard is like his hair, raven black and made sure it stays clean and taken care of. Other than that however it’s bushy and on the wilder side. Sharp eyes rest slightly downturned close above his eyes, giving Daerath a naturally intense look most of the time. Adding to that are his bright green eyes, their colour somewhat uncanny. They don't glow however, it's simply the colour.\n\n{h2:c}Attire{/h2}\nDaerath’s attire is made from a random array of fabrics, the colours mainly shades of red and brown with not much mind paid to making everything look fancy. Other than his patched and brighter coloured shirt there are no patterns or other decorative marks found on it. His clothing is made for a life on the road, to withstand the elements and go through wear and tear. It however doesn’t offer much in the way of protection, even his padded shirt might only protect him against a lighter or unaligned cut from something sharp. A long and thick cloak is often wrapped around him however, made from sturdier material as if woven to be much like a gambeson. \n\n{h2:c}Presence of magic{/h2}\nIt wouldn’t take prying eyes too long to guess that Daerath might either be a fool, hiding something, or use magic of some kind to travel without much, if any protection. And in truth those able to sense it can indeed find threads of an arcane presence emanating from the man. He keeps it somewhat hidden though does not put too much effort into it, as it wouldn’t take much to sense his gift of the arcane. There is however something more, something primal.\nA separate arcane presence can be sensed on the palm of each glove, runes perhaps?\n",

Because of this semi-constant travel, Amanda hadn't really the chance to dedicate herself to one particular path or passion, and instead found solice on paper. Even at younger ages, Amanda sketched or painted the scenes and painted her family would see along their travels in a bid to better rememeber them, finding a love for art through this. \n\n\nHowever, with this semi-nomadic lifestyle along the outscirts of Gilnean land, Amanda's family were hit hard by the worgen onslaught during its early days, loosing her mother and father both to this curse. \n\n",

But her voice and the way she moves, stands and talks would tell anyone knowing the QUEL'DOREI that she is one. Her voice is calm, almost threatening, talking with full confidence with a slight posh accent (i.e a British Andrea Parker). Her face looks friendly with a small smile on her usually unpainted lips. She wears no make-up, so the few, dark freckles under her eyes are there for everyone to see.\n\nHer body is well trained. Her arms and legs quite muscular. She can easily do about 20 pull-ups and run for long times without stopping. Her bust is a delecate b-cup, often hidden beneath armor, making her chest appear slightly flat but puffed up.\n\nThere are not many marks on her body. Just a few small scars you’d get from nasty falls or some brawls gone wrong. There is a long scar on the right side of her face, starting above her eyebrow and ends on her jaw. The scar has a permanent look of a festered state, inches of her skin around it cracked like old porcelain, covering most of the right side of her face. Her eye is pearly white. But she hides this scar behind her long hair at all times.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-80:64:64}\n{col:e5cc7f}Her title, the Runner of Helios, came from a race she once finished first in the name of Farstrider Captain Helios. She used to love running for recreational purposes, and would often be joining marathons and races.\n\nAround two decades ago, AEVANA lost her parents during the attack on QUEL'THALAS along with all her posessions. She and a group of QUEL'DOREI survivors fled to the south, hunted down by trolls, scourge and hunters. After Trolls captured AEVANA and the others and tortured her by disfiguring the right side of her face with the cursed dagger, AEVANA got a hard to cure hatred for Trolls.\n\nThrough the long harsh travel, the withering started to kick in after being away from magic so long and half of the group didn’t make it. The elderly and younger elves just couldn’t get through it cold turkey. After about a year of traveling and fighting and surviving through the withering, the group finally arrived at STORMWIND CITY, where it was said there was a Moonwell. It wasn’t as strong as the Sunwell, but it would help at the very least. After the elves were finally allowed in, they moved into the Park, close to the Moonwell. Even though her skin got some color back, the disfigured skin on the right side of her face never healed.\n\nWith nothing to her name, and a hatred for QUEL'DOREI still strong in the human city, AEVANA had to take any kind of job she could to keep food on the table. She got a knack for engineering and another enigneer in Stormwind could use her help, but it didn't pay much, and as a QUEL'DOREI who couldn't do much with arcane, she fell in with the wrong crowd to try and make a living and managed to get herself into a large debt. Due to this, she was forced to take jobs outside the law, and she began a career as a runner, a person who delivers small packages or information without the law knowing about it. To fit her new lifestyle, she permanently dyed her hair blue with a bit of purple so it fits her pale skin in an attempt to look edgy. She always kept helping in the workshop and her engineering skills kept improving.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-85:64:64}\n{col:e5cc7f}Years later, after a lot of running, she came across a group called the SILVERSHIELD COMPANY, later renamed to the BLACKGARDE ASSOCIATION. They were looking for new recruits and the pay was very decent. AEVANA joined them, and with the monthly pay, she was able to pay off the dept she was in. Although her old \"crew\" didn't want to let a decent runner go, she was backed up by a large group of privately funded soldiers now, so AEVANA was finally free to go. She and the rest of the SILVERSHIELD COMPANY clicked well, and she even made it all the way to Commander of the small army, after which the name of the group was changed to the BLACKGARDE ASSOCIATION. But as all good things that have beginnings, also this had to end.\n\nAfter a succesfull campaign in KUL TIRAS, the BLACKGARDE ASSOCIATION felt their services were no longer needed and AEVANA couldn't find more work for them. The group was disbanded and AEVANA dissapeared for a while. In her time away, she continued her Engineering and moved to PANDARIA, where she also helped on the fields. After 2 years, she returned to STORMWIND CITY.…{/col}\n\n",

Her expertise comes from working for years as a camp follower, assisting the medics and doctors in the medical tents. Her ability to follow instructions and to learn them was quickly realised by the medics and doctors of the camp. The very same people then decided to give her some training in medical arts, when they could spare the time for it.

And Maeve felt overwhelming pressure to join, if only to fit in.\n\nAs time passed, her behaviour changed, the innocent Maeve was trapped and quelled in a rough, but fragile exterior - But it wasnt just her behaviour changing, over time her now boyfriend became aggressive to her, abusing her mentally and physically, her parents barely put any effort into trying to stop her from seeing them, despite the constant bruises she'd come home with. Eventually her parents disowned her after witnessing her commit a crime. Leaving her even more trapped in her situation.\n\nMany years would pass until she was a fully grown adult, her constant years of torment and peer pressure lead her to the boiling point, she eventually snapped on her boyfriend while they were out in Elwynn. Knocking him out with a blunt object and burying him alive just as he came to consciousness. The years of torment grew on her in that moment.\n\nShe now tries to live a normal life, but her past has left her scarred and fragile, yet reinforcing the tough exterior so she wouldn't find herself in a similar situation, she holds a bitter resentment to her family, yet only minorly switching her last name from Ludwidge to Ludwin.",

Slender, yet with some breadth to his shoulders and obvious lean muscle definition to his limbs and torso, it is clear the young elf takes care of himself. As expected of one growing up within the Hinterlands and embracing the more rustic lifestyle there than that of their former home kingdom - doubly so with his passions of archery and hunting.\n\nHis complexion is lightly tanned, both natural and kissed from exposure to the sun. Of what skin he does show, it would be currently blemishless; without any visible pock, scar or mark. Not unusual for one who shies away from combat.\n\nFair features line his face. High cheeks, delicate brows and the slope of a sharp jaw mark him among elven kind, if the large pointed ears and stark blue eyes did not already. Aevyr could be considered comely to some, depending on personal tastes.\n\nShunning away from most finery, a distant call from his kin. Aevyr is comfortable in plain cottons and wools, neutral in colour without much flash or extravagance. The most common colour seen on him is likely white, given the choice of his simplistic Priestly vestments being the same colour.\n\nThe only form of extravagance upon him is the golden Holy Light symbol that hangs from a silver chain around his neck. The chain is large enough to be wrapped around his wrist, as he often does when using it to channel or in prayer. Another recent addition is the plain polished silver band he wears upon his right middle finger.{/col}\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/MAPWo9O.jpg*Portrait (by karrah_e)}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/XYlg3F5.jpeg*Contemplation - full body casual (by karrah_e)}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/kV3EVcC.jpg*Tea time - Portrait with glasses (by 1Enary1)}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/qY4fNVc.png*Respite (by Quincy-Sue)}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/RWc2A43.jpg*Aevyr & Parthoos (by The_zombie_cat)}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/TCj4eUu.jpg*Calling of the Light (by Ayie_OlaerArt)}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}- - - {col:FFD705}P E R S O N A L I T Y{/col} - - -{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}A devout of the Holy Light, the young priest that is Aevyr is full of life that its near bursting from the seams. An optimist at heart, he yearns to see the positivity in all he can. This can put him into trouble and see him as somewhat gullible due to either not seeing obvious truths, or choosing to ignore them.\n\nA kind hearted individual, Aevyr often goes out of his way to ensure his friends and loved ones are at their best. If they aren't happy, then neither is he.\n\nA humble upbringing in the Hinterlands among the fellow Highvale at the Quel'danil Lodge has given Aevyr an appreciation for the simple things in life. Shunning away from the extravagant, he appreciates finery in moderation and shies away from it if given the choice.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h3:c}- - - {col:FFD705}H O O K S{/col} - - -{/h3}\n{col:ffffff}Anything listed below is fair game for pre-established ships or walk up material.
