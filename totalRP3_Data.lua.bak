Somehow, a thic roll of cheese hard as rock dropped from the sky, hit him hard in the head. \nHe lost his memory entirely, including the way of the Arcane, priest said there's a slight chance may gain his memory back. Pray to the Light two times a day he said. \n\nThankfully, he has been allocated to work in a pet shop in stormwind. The granny shop owner is taking good care of him. \n\nHe is a shy, passive individual. Finding it difficult to accustom to the human culture, he is not very proactive talking to people.\n\n",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",
