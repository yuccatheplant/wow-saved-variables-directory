The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose.

Snapping at them gets you no where other than destroying your friendship. If you need to talk / vent. Do it. Don't bottle up and lash out.\n\nHaving the mentality of \"I'm mad therefore it's okay to be a jerk\" Is a completely delusional way of thinking. Especially if you can't apologise for being a jerk after acknowledging that you are / have been one. Being stubborn is one thing but how is it so impossible to own up to your mistakes.\n\nWe learn from our mistakes so we have to acknowledge them and move ahead rather than shrug them off and blame someone else.\n\nI'm a fair soul. I give people chance to say sorry or to try and move forward. People make mistakes so it's more than fair to give them a second chance but when you can't even give them a second chance. What the heck do you do.\n\nPeople aren't there to satisfy you and your needs. They aren't there to chase after you and give you attention. They have their own wants and goals so how is it fair to take from them and their happiness just because you're feeling down. Pry eachother up with friendship rather than dragging everyone else down to your pit of depression.\n\n\n{p:c}TLDR: Don't be a dick.\nBeing calm and collected > Being mad and angry{/p}\n",

But after four years working different Mercenary jobs,\nHe eventually became a humble, kind and generous man who was quite very loyal to his employers and mercenaries.

He is also a ladies man who has married twice with four children.{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} Lack of Intelligence and cowardness {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Xian was quite the reject when he first came to the Eastern Kingdoms All those years ago.

Some treated the boy with respect while some didn’t.\n\nAt 25 years, Sun was wounded by a Hozan chieftain but was saved by his son Xain who in turn killed the Chieftain with his father's sword. After this, Sun retired from being the Captain and settled down with his son.\nThree months later Jinjing was permitted to leave the household as often as she wanted to support her family.\n\nAt 28 years, Xian convinces his parents to let him go with the other Islanders to visit the world. His father, not trusting outsiders, was hesitant  at first, but agreed,  but his mother protested only to agree when she couldn't convince  Sun otherwise. \n\nWith a Hug from his father and a kiss from his mother he left with the rest of the pandaren for the eastern kingdoms.\n{/p}\n",

He clearly pays attention to himself, his hair and beard are very well taken care of and smells of natural, woodly essences if not his usual vanilla and tobacco mix. His daily clothes and boots are cleaned regularly, gear and weaponry often in pristine condition. His manner is usually direct and honest to the bone, minding small details in  many things from conversations to combat, he rarely stops from speaking them out if he thinks it’s a valid point to add, takes his time and double thinks before reaching any sort of judgement or conclusions. An open-minded fellow with a love for things made with honest effort, a buy it for life approach follows his actions throughout the day. Born in the town of Stormglen, he is a man of nature. He is now approaching his thirties, feels ever older and rooted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGilnean Army Paratrooper Division 3rd Company - Sergeant\n\nContract based freelance work in Silverpine, post-war\n\nReformed Gilnean Army, Broken Isles Deployment, two tours.\n\nStormwind Investigations - Detective\n\nAEGIS Division - Director\n\nVarious Crown Intelligence Operations - Spec Ops.\n\nBright and Rose PI - Chief Inspector\n\nStormwind Marshal Services - Deputy Marshal\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n{/h3}\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/239178*Special Services Bureau}\nArchival pages.\n\n{link*https://i.ibb.co/0hBVSZ0/SSB-LOGO.png*SSB Patch}\nShoulder sleeve insignia worn on the upper left arm on certain outfits.\n\n{link*https://forms.gle/TVF2uyjdUj2njxej6*SSB Application Form}\nTo be filled and returned.\n\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/HeywoodArt*A portait of Heywood}\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/RbGzywR*Stormwind Marshal Services Badge}\nA metal ring insets on a varnished leather background, elegantly sat and held in place with artisan screws, the lion design is glued in.\n\n",

I say \"was\" because this house is no more.\nI am the last member of my House. And the hunt is nearly all I know this past 16 years. Hunt, war and death.\nMy parents taught me some nobilities and common sense and knowledge. But the most important lessons were to never give up no matter the reason and to trust in my animals.\nIn my family, I had a younger brother. I loved him and played with him as long as we can. Until a disease got him at the age of 7. I was 9 at this moment. We used to play the hunters with our puppies, Bard and Bernie, in the forests, looking for \"trophies\" or \"treasures\".\nI seriously began my training as a hunter when I was 11. Hunting for bigger preys with my father until I was 15 or 16 when I began to hunt by myself. This hunts were meant to prepare myself to become a master hunter, a title only a few can claim and pretend to use our family weapon, Stormbringer.\nAt 18 years old, I could have meet my death when I was hunting a worgen who was suspected for commiting atrocities in the villages close to Gilneas. After a long fight and badly injured, Bard gave his life to let me take the shot against the monster. I was found nearly dead by Bernie two days later and woke up 4 weeks after the incident. With only the scar of my fight as a reminder. My father also told me the worgen was controlled by a witch. But he took care of it while I was recovering.\nDuring the siege of Gilneas by the Forsaken, my father bought us time to escape with my mother out of the city and following the others to the harbor. When I arrived at Darnassus, I offered my help to King Greymane to aid our new allies fighting the war against the Horde. I was 20 at this time.\nSince then, I am now venturing between countries or worlds. Hunting down any beasts, monsters, demons or witches.{/col}",

					["TX"] = "{h1:c}Brief History{/h1}\n\n{p:c}Atterbury was a loyal man to Houses Stormsong and Proudmoore, fighting in both the Second and Third Wars for Kul Tiras, he was not present at Theramore due to a gruesome injury, which had left him bedridden for months. One he had recovered, Daelin Proudmoore had fallen and Kul Tiras soon left the ranks of the Alliance, leaving Caleb Atterbury to continue his life at his home, Stormsong Valley.\n\nShortly before the events of the Fourth War, Caleb Atterbury left the ranks of the Tideguard under House Stormsong, like many of his brothers and sisters amongst the Tidesages as well, he had began to sense a great, looming darkness from the depths. Once loyal enough to lay his life and future down at the feet of House Stormsong, Atterbury did not waste a moment to join the Storm's Wake once it was formed, to put a end to this perversion of something so many of his people believed in.\n\nAfter the fall of Lord Stormsong, the once gentle man that had been twisted and corrupted by the whispers of the depths, Atterbury returned to active service under House Proudmoore, fighting  his way amongst many others through Dazar'alor and barely surviving the events that unfolded at Nazjatar.\n\nAs the Fourth War came to it's conclusion and the Alliance and Horde formed their armistice, Atterbury could not simply return back to his peaceful life, without battle, without a cause or war to fight. The man now seeks to teach and guide others down a very similar path as his own, to learn what it means to be a soldier, what it means to have convictions and what truly matters to one in the end.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Links{/h2}\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/242748*Argent Archives + Art.}",

Growing up in the city of Stormwind he had a rather typical upbringing, including playing with the children he went to school with, exploring the park district when he had a moments rest from the schoolwork and misbehaving when all the other kids would get up to no good. He was a normal child, or so he thought..  {/p}\n\n{p:c}It was around the age of ten that his parents started to notice small things that Xantius would unintentionally do, randomly lifting object from tables and shelves or swirling his milk with no spoon. This obviously worried them deeply, especially Xantius' father who did not like the thought of his son being a magic user, he wanted him to take over as his successor at the wheat farms after-all. So they decided to keep it a secret from everyone they knew, including the drunken uncle, who actually didn't notice much of what was going on with being drunk most of the day, Family friends and Xantius' school friends wouldn't find out about his magical tendencies until much later in his life..  {/p}\n\n{p:c}For many years of keeping Xantius indoors and away from others, his mother home schooled him and taught him everything that she knew, this made Xantius' friends think poorly of him when they saw that he had been removed from school so suddenly, thinking that he was sick, some went to even think he was contageous and had to be kept away from others! Rumours though they where, this still upset Xantius greatly. ((insert more about homeschool life)) \nWhen his father returned from his long day at work he would always treat Xantius in a cold and stern way, most likely ashamed of what his son was.\n\n On one night whilst his parents were asleep Xantius snook out of the homestead and went to the park district so that he could feel the air on his skin, reliving moments that he used to have when he was a kid, but on this late night wander he came across a rune enscribed box sat on the park bench, he picked it up and the runes on the outer sides of the box started to glow, he was in awe by this magical trinket, suddenly from behind a tree a large hooded figure stepped out and spoke to him about how the box reacts to magic and explaining to him that he was different from everyone else, how he could unlock his hidden potential by studying the magical arts. This made Xantius eager to learn of magic, which his family was shocked at him for realising his hidden magical abilites. Continuously asking about magic and how he wanted to an apprentice, this infuriated his father so much that he would storm out of the house after shouting at the whole family, one day this was too much for Xantius to handle.. {/p}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-alliance-Knight:256:128}\n{p:c}Three years go by on the homestead and Xantius' dreams of becoming a mage never diminish, He only wishes he could start learning with his family's blessing's, but that will never happen and he knew it. So when nobody was around he would attempt at levitating objects and play with fire from a candle stick, turning it different colours, mere childsplay to a master mage. One day his father came home early and caught Xantius playing with the fire from the candle stick, He went into a frenzy, smashing objects and throwing chairs, Xantius' mother cried and pleaded for him to stop but this only made his father fall into an enraged state. Xantius had finally had enough of it all. With all his fury he made flames from out of nowhere and threw it at his father, burning his face and hair, knocking him unconscious, the flames from the blast setting the curtains on fire and the house began to burn, Stubbornly his mother never leaves the side of his father, and urges Xantius to leave them to their fate. Xantius manages to escape the burning homestead within an inch of his life, coughing and spluttering he looked up to see his home burning to the ground, Xantius vows to never use magic to harm another living person again and to only use it for good, But first he must set out and make a life of his own, a life full of adventure and magic..  {/p}\n\n{h1}{col:ff954d}Becoming of age!{/h1}\n{p:c}Four years go by, traveling, trading and doing the odd favour for the townfolk are just some of the hobbies Xantius has, the biggest hobby being that of practicing magic from scrolls and tomes. He thinks back to the burning of his home sometimes but he always tries to stay positive, even in the darkest hour.  {/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TheInnKeepersDaughter:512:256}\n\n {img:Interface\\Pictures\\11482_crystals_east:256:256}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-mage-cover:256:256}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-14:64:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-88:64:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-MageTowerAlliance:512:256}\n\n\n",

While closer scrutiny reveals the suit to be well-tested in the heat of battle - with small cracks and cuts adding texture to what would've otherwise been perfectly smooth steel - at the most basic glance the figure emanates radiant glory, like a beacon of embodied Light among Azeroth's normalcy.\n\nShould the gem-encrusted helmet come off, it would reveal the stoic face of a Draenei veteran, whose light-blue skin and urgent, solemn visage is peppered by smaller scars. A pair of magnificent, pearl-white sideburns implies age and wisdom, while the bony, symmetrical ridges of his skull plates give him an air of stout determination.\n\nWhat should, realistically, bear the weight of a small horse, seems to be carried with surprising lightness, as the figure strides with snappy, calculated movements and an unburdened swiftness that, while not comparable to a Human scout in leather, certainly seems out of place on a heavily-plated soldier. The segmented nature of the armor plates certainly suggests a higher degree of flexibility, as well, naturally lending itself to combat.\n\nThe Draenei's physique below the armor and leather undergarments is a testament to millenia of strife, as is the case with most Draenei men. His sheer, imposing bulk makes it easy to determine he has swung many a weapon, and spent much of his life in heavy armor. The stately height of his being translates just as well into the width of his muscled limbs, and one would be hard-pressed to find any traces of an lavish lifestyle about him.\n\n{h2:r}{icon:TRADE_ARCHAEOLOGY_DRAENEI_ARTIFACTFRAGMENT:25} Personality, Backstory{/h2}\n\nThese are things best discovered in interaction, not visible at a single glance from his outward appearance.\n\n\n",

His parents wanted him to inherit the farm but they realised that would never happen.\n\n So after many uyears of thinking they decided to send him off to his uncle who lived in stormwind who was a retired mercenery. His uncle started training him in many differnt types of weapons but Draxxos who had worked at a farm his entire life so far was quite strong which made him gravitate towards twohanders like greatswords battleaxes and polearms. So they became his favroites however he was also pretty good at duel weilding onehanders. His uncle saw great promise in Draxxos after many years of training he gave Draxxos his old armor and weapons and told him to find a his first contract.\n\nThis Draxxos did and his first contract was to kill a evil necromancer which was said to live in loch modan so Draxxos took a gryphon there. After three weeks of serching hw found the necromancers hideout. Thinking what to do he sneaked in to the best of his ability but the necromancer spoted him and thwey fought for a good while until Draxxos finally killed her. After this Draxxos looked around at all the stuff she had and found a rune which glowed blood red and icey blue and so he picked it up and it directly shatterd in his hand blue and red energy surged in to his eyes and he blacked out.\n\nWhen he woke he was able to use ice and blood magic it took many years and at the age of 30 after countless contracts he was finally able to control his magical abililaties. Ever since then he has been and still is a mercenary.\n\nEventually Draxxos parents died. At the age of 35 he inherited there farm but since he did not like the farmers life and did grow up most of his youth in stormwind he instead of working there he hired workers who pays him by working there and in return get to live there for free.\n",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

He stands at an average - tall height and he is slim and slightly muscular. It is easily noticeable that Ethan doesn't take care of himself at all, it's like his body is protesting against his lifestyle. He doesn't bathe often; he doesn't eat and drink enough; the bags under his eyes are a testament to his amazing sleep schedule. \n\nEthan has an oval face with angular cheekbones and a broad forehead. His deep light-blue eyes sat below his blonde eyebrows that seemed to be perfectly straight near his aquiline nose. He keeps his mouth closed in a thin, straight line, and his bald head reveals his wide forehead. \n\nTwo adjacent scars run over his right eye. A deep-cut scar running from his left ear, across his cheekbone could be easily seen. On his right shoulder, a deep scar could be seen from what used to be a second-degree burn. The scar had been pink years ago, now it was more shiny and pale.\n\nHis personality is reflected by his outward appearance. Ethan always looks angry, like a rough hateful man. To those who look past the hateful man can actually see the broken man which resides inside.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Personality Traits{/h2}{p:c}Ethan often acts as a rough and a hateful man, he scoffs and curses, and most of the time he is stubborn as if he always tries his best to get what he wants. Most know him as a rude man who demands respect even though he doesn't show any in return. Ethan demands control over the situation and he is willing to bicker and fight to get his way. It is clear to many that he is definitely not scared to show his opinion, regardless of the situation. \n\nHis personality was drastically changed due to certain events in his life. At his young age, Ethan used to be a good kid. He was often helpful, kind, and known for his behavior to stimulate others to do the right thing. Sometimes his good intention could turn out bad, but deep down in his heart, he wanted those around him to feel good near him. \nThose who gain his trust can sometimes see his old character return.\n\nOnce his trust is gained in any way, it's best if that person lives up to the trust, as he finds it highly offensive to misplace it, especially when it comes to promises.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}History{/h2}{p:c}[ Please know that this will be rewritten soon. I'm just laying a layout here. ] \n\nAnders Anton, son of Frederik Anton who was High Protector and member of the Order of the Silver Hand. \n\nAnders was born in Andorhal, the distribution center of Northern Lordaeron. His family lived there because his father Frederik was in the army to take care of the Scourge. In the army Frederik saw that the Scourge used horrific methods to spread the plague to turn others into undead. \n\nAnders Anton was born in Northern Lordaeron in a place called Andorhal. His father Frederik heard of a rumor that the village would be attacked by the Scourge. Before they came, Anders and his family fled from Andorhal to the capital city of Lordaeron. The Order saw this as an act of cowardness and treason. But Frederik didn't seem to mind. All he seemed to care about is to protect his family. \n\nThey lived in Lordaeron for a few months before they continued to travel to live behind the great wall of Gilneas. Frederik knew that his family would be safe there. But when they reached the great wall, the Gilneans refused to let them pass because of Frederik's wife, Anders his mother. They didn't seem to understand what why they couldn't go through, well- Anders didn't seem to understand. They continued traveling to Stromgarde where they lived for a few years. \n\nAnders grew up here{/p}",

This was mostly down to the fact that she was hardly ever stressed, and often took time to think about things.\n\nHer mane would be messy in style, not exactly groomed too much, but clean in terms of sanitation, with it being clear that she must shower often to maintain that spotless mane.\n\nMoving onto her other features, her bust would be a quite ample for her size. Kali would be a very bottom heavy gal, with most of her weight being distributed to her thighs, resulting in them being rather formidable, especially at her size as a Worgen. Another effect of this, that would be rather noticeable without the cloak attempting to conceal most of it, would be her massive behind. On any other race, this might not mean much, but on Kali it is very noticable when not concealed, especially in terms of Worgen proportions. {/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff7f00}BACKSTORY{/col}\n\nStarting out as a mage in Gilneas who was interested in science, she soon became obsessed with the idea of advancing science by any means necessary. She started out small, performing experiments within the comforts of her home. Kali soon found that her equipment lacked the precision and accuracy she was looking for, so she decided to go out and look.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the day she was going to leave was the same day the Horde attacked. She ended up getting bitten while trying to defend herself using her fire magic, feeling stranger as time went on. She shrugged it off and made her way to the harbour, having some idle conversations with her fellow survivors who were also boarding the Elven ship.\n\nWhile sailing to Darnassus, she overheard some conversations about mages who perform experiments in Dalaran. She had heard of Dalaran before from the very few scientific articles in the Gilnean times. Kali was sure this was the place she wanted to go, even to the point of spending most of her coin to get there.\n\nThe bite began to take effect as she was travelling, transforming her into a Worgen. Kali was horrified and yet, intrigued at her new appearance. She knew that she had little time to keep her sanity and so she hurried to Dalaran, ignoring any advice that was given to her by the Elves.\n\nKali was just in awe at how effective the city was, struggling to take a few notes in her Worgen form as she arrived. Soon after, she found what she was looking for. A group that was interested in the study of the world using science. They noticed her as a Worgen and said they had developed a cure, independent of the Druids. The cure was surprisingly a success, and they allowed her to join for being such a successful test subject.\n\nShe slowly made her way up through the group, eventually making it as high as head scientist in the biochemical lab. Though, the normal experiments of the group wouldn’t last. They would be thrust into a war against the Legion, where they all took things very seriously.\n\nAll of the group’s efforts were focused on ways to combat the Legion, coming up with various ideas ranging from powerful mana bombs to chemical warfare. They eventually settled on an idea to use feral Worgen to their advantage, a project they dubbed ‘Night Howl’.\n\nThey decided to go to Silverpine forest in their search for ferals, eventually finding a Worgen with a pack of Worgs. This Worgen was sedated and any Worgs killed as they took her back to Dalaran. The group eventually came up with the name ‘Worg Howl’ for their new Worgen, after the Worgs she travelled with previously.\n\nShe was quickly cured in a similar way to Kali. Worg was then taught sign language and then how to read once they were able to communicate with her. Through this reading, she slowly learned common. This wasn’t her main purpose, however, as the group, most notably Kali, began injecting her with all sorts of substances they had developed in an attempt to make her resist any fear and derive pleasure from pain.\n\nThese substances seemed to do the trick as Worg became a literal killing machine, enjoying the bloodbaths she created. They sent Worg out to the front lines during the fight against the Legion, with her killing many demons alongside all sorts of allies.\n\nOnce the Legion was defeated, Worg’s purpose was no longer useful to the group. They decided to let her go free into the forest of Duskwood. Kali wasn’t too happy about that and decided to leave the group before they went into hiding.\n\nNow a lone scientist, Kali must find her own future.{/p}\n\n\n\n\n",

This led to Leonie struggling to make actual connections to people she saw as close to her, and prefers bonds where people are kept at an arm’s length away from her heart during her youth.\nThe lack of actual attention from family and a history of healing made Leo naturally curious about anatomy, despite her own magical talents leading her down the path of studying in the Mage District. This curiosity pulled her into a morbid obsession surrounding death and necromancy, and whilst she never dabbled in darker magics herself she could never truly deny the fact it fascinated her.\nCurrently, Leonie continues her studies into magic and her hobby of researching death and anatomy with ghoulish delight. She will never practice necromancy herself, she just likes to learn about it.",

She will study, locked away in her room for days on end, without a complaint and whilst she’s no shining star of the class she manages to succeed in most tasks she has been set. Her love of all things surrounding death and necromancy, however, make her one that the instructors keep a very close eye on. She does NOT practice necromancy, as she understands it is illegal and immoral. It is merely a fascination with learning how it works.\n-Leonie doesn’t have much of a social life at all, her face most likely being an unknown in the city streets despite living there all her life. The Wyther name might be known, however, as both of her parents assist with any major healing work that needs doing within the human territories.",

Measured at a measly 161cm and weighing around 65-odd kilograms, he carries a strangely lean and androgynous form that would see some label him as a woman. Pleasant, light brown hair that seems to flow in smooth lines of finest silk often finds itself tucked in a stylized ponytail to the envy of many. Draping on either side, it frames an angelic face with both young and sharp, androgynous features and slim, devious lips of pale pink. A small nose is flanked by innocent eyes coursing with moonlit silver hues that seem to constantly watch those around him expressively. His elven ears can often be seen twitching, prone to capturing even the slightest of sounds which hints at either natural talent or perhaps military background. Notably, he seems to lack blemishes or any other such imperfection.\n\nA slim and tender neck is flanked by a pair of lean shoulders and and equally small torso whose outlines fall mostly flat. Surprisingly, musculature is present all throughout, pointing towards athleticism and a life of regimented training though strikingly ordinary. It’s the kind you would find on an athletic teenager or woman: unpronounced, it simply exists to replace any accumulated fat, giving him an incredibly nimble and unexpectedly appealing frame; In fact, many describe him as both feline and agile rather than a powerhouse.\n\nMore notably though, his legs are agile and lean, further revealing the permeance of a military background in a former life, odd for someone with such contrasting features. As for his skin, it is a remarkable shade of white, a pale canvas remiss of a snowy day in winter. In fact, its softness and complexion are as ephemeral as snowflakes and equally as striking at first glance.\n\nHe's usually seen, when not expecting an assignment, in a casual outfit built to enhance his innocent qualities. A navy silk shirt that seems a few sizes too big pans down in long sleeves that cover his hands, sleeves which he seems to constantly grip, fingers wrapped around their hem idly. Complementing his shirt is a pair of leather pants, black in coloring, that contrast in how they stick to the shapely for below his waist and tuck neatly into a pair of combat boots with steel-tipped toes.\n\nMost of the time, however, he’s seen wearing something much more conspicuous. A leather attire supplanted with armored plating gives way to tales of the past. Portions of old and battered plated armor, meant for blood knights, protect key portions of his frame and tell tales of a past serving the High Kingdom. Dressed in tones of Scarlet and Black, his military background becomes painfully obvious even if he often chooses to mask his face with an equally black scarf. However, parts of his armor are missing, his attire a mixture of a rogue’s wear and a Blood Knight’s protection, meant to emphasize mobility while compromising as little protection as possible, the cuirass remains, as do the shoulders, though one would be remiss to find any plate at the joins or around the abdomen, instead kept to protect the rib-cage.\n\n{h1:c}Demeanor{/h1}\nAccording to those who know him, Taelyn displays a very meek and reserved attitude. Many equate him to a child who is afraid of the world yet is innocent enough to expect the best from all. He walks around in a coy and self-protective manner but exudes a glimmering shine in his eyes, one of hope. He's quick to make friends with those he doesn't know and quicker to expose what he perceives as the best parts of him to them. Despie talking in an equally soft and meek voice, he's a fairly outgoing boy with a child's heart and a loving, cherished smile. He's often seen biding his time in conversation, almost as if afraid to express himself due to fear of disrupting others.\n\nRecent accounts display a grimmer reality, however. If tales are to be believed, the SI7 agent known as Twilight is another facet of this young man. Those who've seen him and lived to tell the tale describe him as a ruthless, efficient shadow, a ghost who enters as naught but a soft breeze and leaves behind a bloodbath. Many describe his combat style as a dance of blades, one of ruthless precision and cruel intent.\n\nOthers say he's manipulative and enticing, seductive and womanly. A Femme Fatale who seduces men and women alike, manipulating their strings like puppets made to do his bidding and then discarding after their use has been met.\n\n{h1:c}Word of Mouth{/h1}\nNot much is known of Taelyn’s past nor of his present. Many Ren’dorei say that he’s been there since the start, supporting Umbric’s efforts in menial ways such as obtaining information. Despite this, not much is known about him except that he’s always been an odd and reserved person, confiding only in Umbric and his inner circle and only when required. Outside that, he always seemed like a brave and happy young man who saw others as people to befriend and not trouble.",

Her physiognomy often mirrors the ill omen that swathes her unscrupulous disposition. Altruism and sympathy stand foreign concepts to Jhenvieve, for her pedigree often compels her to appraise everything with a pragmatic state of mind. Two refined strips of hair, akin to red clusters of vibrissae, line the ridge above two hereditary orbs of amber. Her ineptitude to fathom sympathy fails to eclipse the prospect of boasting impeccable aesthetics. \n\nPlatonically, Jhenvieve’s beguiling elegance and grace testify to her stature as a socialite. Maquillage often swathes Jhenvieve’s countenance, veiling the scarce imperfections she bears beyond a nigh-translucent tapestry of colourful cosmetics. Whilst by no means a connoisseur of beauty, Jhenvieve’s appearance is indubitably sublime. An auburn mane of tresses sits at the pinnacle of her silhouette, bracketing her countenance betwixt a chasm of ever-shifting strands of hair.\n\nJhenvieve’s hellbent on perfection in every aspect and her physique isn’t an exception. Rigorous physical activity compels the woman’s musculature to maintain her athletic build. She’s by no means gargantuan, yet underestimating the unbridled force of the impact she’s liable to deliver could turn catastrophical for the recipient of her ire. She bears a curvaceous silhouette, in spite of her athleticism. \n\nJhenvieve’s armaments are arguably sharper than the juvenile wit of a court jester. Her girdle is encompassed with a various assortment of weaponry. An intricately forged dagger engraved with obscure glyphs resides within a scabbard, embroidered by an illustrious craftsman’s hand. She’s also equipped with an obsidian pionard, spanned betwixt the circular silhouette of the coiled viper she often brandishes. Augmented pouches, presumably containing a plethora of inanimate objects are firmly knotted to her girdle. Last but definitely not least, a hollow tube often oscillates with her gallivanting. It’s fastened to her girdle as well. \n\nJhenvieve’s frequently encompassed with a collection of illustrious trinkets. Quintessential craftsmanship was evidently paramount to craft Andeaur’s ring. A protruding ridge of silver illustrates a bevelled projection of a bleak tree, encompassed by a squircle plaque of obsidian minerals. It gradually transitions into a golden circle, designed to fit Jhenvieve’s finger. A triangle socket orbits around an exquisite gem of ruby furthermore connected to a silver chain, boosting her prodigal decorum with unnecessarily flamboyant flair.  \n",

Jackson did his best to protect the still living people of Lorderon, seeing the chaos and rise of new factions. He saw the silver hands fate, the spawning of the scarlet crusade and much more.\nAnd then, a fateful day. Foolish passion brought him to a fight he couldn’t win, he was cut down.

And in their numbers he went, fighting in their case, even staying with them for a time.\nBut due to arthas being gone, he eventually struck out on his own.

The hair itself was also turning light due to the sun exposure, as it would keep a darker shade of brown otherwise. The soldier would mostly be seen wear his plate uniform, but if he was given the chance, he would be dressed in his casual cloth, yet the golden and blue tabard remained fixed to his pride.\n\nThe plate covered soldier was in quite athletic shape due to the several years of service in the army, aswell as the heavy gear, something that was not too uncommon for him to brag about and show off.\nHis weaponry is mostly consisted of a two handed sword as he believed in the offensive doctrine, yet he was trained in wearing a shield, and range weaponry too.\nEven with his young age he's still been on the move and seen the rare landscapes and species across the sea due to the excess of training and movement provided by the army.\n\nMinor damage such as scorching, scratches and dents can be seen over his armor, but nothing major, as his officer had made sure to teach him the value of a clean armor, the hard way.\nIt was a light hearted person with pretty dark and perverse humor, always wearing a necklace with dog-tags around his neck that rattles with his movement, making sure he can be often be heard when approaching.{/p}\n\n\nPCU trash gets ignored.\n",

By no means shallow or lacking in wit, rather she chooses her points of interest well.\n\n\nPracticality refined to an alluring beauty, the elf knows that some things are better kept simplistic, lacking in the need to be improved upon. Be it the well made armour that often covers her form, the neatly tied alabaster hair, or lips accentuated by just a touch of violet. \n\n\nPhysically fit and beyond able. Strong legs with defined arms and shoulders to match them, her craft is easy to figure out. If the bow, which rarely strays too far, doesn't do just that to begin with. Still, there's more than meets the eye - A recurring theme when it comes to the woman. An aura of the arcane betrays a leaning towards the arts which were still recently forbidden to many. {/col}\n\n",
