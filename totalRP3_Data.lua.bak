Where she might not be as strong as the warrior type, she has grown to use other means to prosper. Without the respect from most of the Orc kind, she has still set herself a code of Honor she wont stride from. What stands out on her most, are her bright purple eyes. Their sharp shape are a hint of her clever mind and quick wit she often likes to lash out at those around her. Oftenly, she has dark colour or even ash smeared around her eyes, mostly to hide her skin colour as she wears her veil. It is not often, especially in the big Cities that she would walk without a mask. When you do see her without any coverage, her slim neck hints of a structure she hides within her armor. Her jawline is slim, not as strong and prominant as it usually would be on her kind. All this, makes you consider wheter she is only weak, but she carries herself with a strong, confident stride. Her arms seems strong enough to fight with her weapons and her slimmer legs still give her a swift phase in battle.{/col} \n\n\n\n\n                                    {icon:INV_Leather_RaidRogue_Q_01Chest:25}{col:53996d}Attire and weaponry{/col} {icon:INV_Sword_137:25}:\n\n\n{col:5d4476}Always wearing atleast few layers of leather, she prefers to hide as much of herself as possible, exception being her arms as she feels a certain amount of pride of the strenght she has been able to build. Her armor hides various hidden pockets for small weaponry like daggers or small poison vials. The thick layers of leather hide small amounts of light plating or chain within them, only enough to protect the most crucial points oner body, but wont narrow down her movement too much. On her belt, she always carries the same twin blades. Well kept and clean, the weapons show little wear from the battles she has taken them trough.\n\n{/col}\n\n\nHave some Solgra picturs: \n\nMy own scribbles:\n\n{link*https://xewspaws.deviantart.com/art/Solgra-venturing-to-dark-edgy-places-678273285*Pictur}\n\n{link*https://xewspaws.deviantart.com/art/Solgra-677980777*Anodda pictur}\n\nActual art:\n\n{link*https://www.deviantart.com/coffeeandbiscuits/art/Solgra-Deathstride-Commission-839968176* Solgra by coffeeandbiscuits}\n\n",

As such, she trained twice as hard when duty called for her - and it showed. \n\nClad in light-weight, magically infused plate armor, she carried herself with a sense of purpose. Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

This patch resembles a texture similar to that of a brush. The hair is fine, yet rough at the same time.\n\nThough this young Vulpera is mostly unscathed of the markings of war, the occasional scar can be found scattered across his form. The most noticeable marking, whilst not outstanding by any means, is the scar on his left brow. More often than not, this fox has traces of sand dotted around his fur as a result of his excessive use of sand.\n\nHis attire consists of simple cloth clothing, dressed over with some light leather padding. At the centre of this fox hangs a surcoat, holding the sigil of the Voldunai. Additionally, Lupo has cloth bindings wrapped around both his shins and forearms. Though it may be obvious to some that these are to cover the marks of his slave life, he tries to avoid bringing any attention to it that may lead to unwanted questioning. Finally, strapped upon his back is a ceramic gourd. Roughly the size of his torso, this gourd is filled to the brim with sand. Sand that Lupo can call to his aid for whatever need he may have for it.\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689257742984282129/743071920723067020/lupo800px.png*Half body art of Lupo!} drawn by {link*https://twitter.com/glowcrow*Glowcrow!}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741188065187332148/809169479182450739/lupo_orig_wm.png?width=712&height=852*Full body comission of Lupo!} drawn by the amazing {link*https://twitter.com/glowcrow*Glowcrow} once again!\n\n",

Though for much of his younger life, he lived amongst his kin. Running across the dunes in caravans in search of scavenging, trading, and of course, hiding from The Faithless.\n\nLupo was still just a kit when his life took a terrible turn. Being the curious Vulpera he continues to be today, the much younger Lupo ventured out a little too far from the encampment. He had spotted another young vulpera, one he was sure wasn't amongst his caravan party was before him in the dunes. Their actions seemed playful, beckoning Lupo to follow. He did so rather willingly, completely oblivious to what would happen to him. The Vulpera led him to a small ridge within the dunes, far enough from his caravan for them to be unable to hear or see him. Within the ridge he was quickly set upon by a group of Sethrak. The vulpera he had followed was bait. A slave of the Sethrak and now, Lupo would share the same fate.\n\nHe spent the rest of his childhood and even the early stages of adulthood within captivity. As if life in the dunes wasn't hard enough, he became the very thing his kin sought to avoid. The life of a slave took its toll on all Vulpera and Lupo was no different. Continuous labour work had began to get the better of him. He had nearly given up. On the verge of being broken. His body was frail, as was his mind. Dehydration left him with little to no strength. Lupo would finally reach his limit during a day of heavy labour, the sun at its highest peak as the heat absorbed what little energy he had left. Collapsing to the floor, he looked out into the distant dunes, he reached out towards it. He could hardly even hold his arm up, slumping to the floor he gripped the sands within his hand. His eyes became heavy, slowly drifting in and out of unconciousness until within moments, it took him. It was here, that he had a vision. The sands spoke to him. Despite being on the verge of breaking completely, they admired his will he carried with him. To remain headstrong in the face of what more often than not certain death for his kin in the life of a slave, along with the vigilance he had of keeping in line with the Sethrak in hopes of one day finding the time to gain freedom. It seemed that today was that day.\n\nHe woke from his unconsciousness, still weakened and dehydrated. A group of Sethrak hovering over his body. They deemed him useless for work and so, prepared to dispose of him.  No, he wouldn't allow them. He mustered up the strength to raise a hand in defence and with that, the sands answered. They raised with his hand, shooting out from the sands in the form of spikes, impaling the Sethrak that surrounded him. How? He thought. Within moments of what he saw in his vision, he had the ability to manipulate the sands so easily. He felt stronger and so, more determined. He used the sands to wrap around his chains, crushing them under its weight and then doing so with the rest of the Vulperan slaves he was with. They made their escape from the Sethrak, going seperate ways soon after. Lupo would not take this gift bestowed upon him for granted. From then, he would regularly meditate and communicate with the elements and the sands, seeking to learn and understand them greater and in turn, bettering his abilities.",

Standing at an average height, clad in formfitting - if somewhat impractical - leathers, the woman's single most noticeable feature would perhaps be her mass of ginger tresses. Often left loose to its own accord, it's clear that aside from the occasional wash, not much effort goes into maintaining the length or style of her hair. The same principle applies to most other aspects of her appearance, including makeup; in which case none is worn. Upon closer inspection, a constant affinity for the sunny outdoors of the South has left her with a small smattering of freckles along her nose and cheeks - though hard to spot from a distance thanks to a tanned complexion.\n\nAlthough typically slouched, beneath the laidback demeanor and hunched shoulders is an Elf that's well trained and surprisingly disciplined. Having honed several skills to survive in the wilds of the Vale, Lynn's physique is an example of someone in near-peak condition.. If she laid off the alcohol. {/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-Everbloom:256:256}\n\n",

His parents have been hunters in the area for as long as he can remember, having moved to there before he was born. They lived in the untamed wilds, away from the settlements and out of the faction's their reach. They would only seek civilization when they had to trade for supplies that nature could not easily provide.\n\nThe Marsh is a harsh and dangerous area and so some are not too picky on who to make allies with. \"Anyone not pointing a weapon at you is your friend.\" is the saying some live by. As a result, Truun's family traded with both factions. His Orcish and Common are more fluent than his Taurahe as this was actually not spoken much, not even by his parents.\n\nAlthough his parents are hunters, they refrained from using ranged weapons such as bows. They said that \"your kill isn't worth anything if you don't work for it hard enough, that you should not let the winds do the work for you\". As such, Truun has done a lot of running in his youth.\n\nLife in the Marsh was hard. Dangerous animals roamed around, the black dragonflight would sometimes darken the skies and the grimtotem always kept you on edge. When Theramore fell, tension rose. Those that could be relied on for trade before, could not be relied on anymore, or worse. \n\nOver time, these harsh conditions made Truun wonder why his parents once decided to move to the Marsh, why they left their tribe, what their tribe even was. It were questions that his parents never gave answers to, their tribe was never spoken about. As his unexpected connection with the elements grew, these questions became more burning. \n\nSo it was then, when Truun once again asked about his parent’s past, that his father spoke the words that would mark the beginning of Truun’s departure from the Marsh. This was a few years ago, after the occurence of the cataclysm and the fall of Theramor.\n\nHe still hasn't found any answers, but he did find a tribe he can call his own.\n",

Once there, the only advice he got was to go to Neltharions Lair alone. While he was there, he experienced a vision about Neltharion in his former lair in High Mountain. After the vision, he discovered a big two handed axe while trying to find his proto drake, who was sitting next to it. After asking the Spiritwalkers, it seems this wasn't a weapon one of their people had accidentally left behind. He named it \"The Afterthought\", referring to the rather odd ‘on the side’ discovery of it after the vision. The weapon already had a name of its own however.\n\nIt was only after the assistance of a member of the Earthen Ring that set up a ritual that the true name of the weapon became known. During the ritual, an earth elemental emerged and revealed that the weapon was called \"Theraz'gor the Earthshaper\". It was created by Neltharion and his servants with the purpose of being passed down as a tool to his most trusted champion's in the time to come. Champions that would help him in his duties and lighten the burden that weighed so heavily on him. However, this time never came as his mind slipped into madness. \n\nIt is as yet unknown why Truun happened upon this weapon.",

The ribbon is creased like it was once tied but has since fallen out and remains on the stem of the rose by sitting delicately on the leaves.\n\nHer hair is a bright red colour that reaches the small of her back but seems to always be tied up in a long braid that sits over her shoulder. The band that holds the hair together at the end is of a gold colour and seems to be aged from the wear on it but well loved. When let down the ends look a little ragged as if it was cut with a knife by someone who had unsteady hands.\n\nHer eyes are green with a tint of blue to them, they look almost doll-like at times. The rest of her face seems to match her eyes in how it looks naive and curious and is speckled with freckles along her cheeks, nose and forehead. There is a small scar on the left side of her face along her jawline, looking like something was dragged from near her ear to her chin. The edges of the scar look like it was torn and has not formed a crisp edge.\n\nDianaria is quite lean in her body type with little to no muscle definition. There is a little definition of her waist as it comes in slightly but under her armour she seems to have no waist. On the bicep of her right arm are a few straight scars down to her elbow from arrows catching, other than that her body seems to be free of any other marks or scars.\n\nHer usual style of clothing is something she can fix easily. Her armour unless it is shiny and new has had a few places replaced here and there from the chainmail to any details. It tends to be a little loose around her chest and arms so she can move her arms around easily, a small bag sits tied around her left thigh with 1 bandage, a needle and thread and a set of gloves.

He otherwise looks like you'd expect a jungle troll to look, with a hunched stance and a thick mane of hair, night blue in colour and gathered in long braids. \nHis eyes are large, and the pupils are a fiery dark orange.  \nHis tusks are smaller than average, standing out to the sides and less in the way than most of his kin. One is noticeably shorter than the other, with a point that looks filed and sharpened rather than natural. \nZunaj speaks the common and orcish tongues fluently, almost free of the troll accent, and heavily influenced by the goblin accent and slang. When speaking in his mother tongue, Zandali, he appears rusty, as if he hasn't used the language in years.\n\nIf he is seen exposed, there are a myriad of scars upon his body. Old wounds that few others than trolls would have survived, and nasty burns that his natural regeneration could never fully repair.\n\n{h2:c}The Gear{/h2}\n\nWhat really sets Zunaj apart from most of his kin is in his attire and equipment. His armour is bulky, and made of a combination of leather, chainmail and metal plates, adding even more to his bulk and weight. It's crafted in a modern, goblin fashion, and trinkets, tools and explosives can be found in tactical places all over. \nEven the armour itself seems to have a few mechanical parts, although at first glance, it's hard to tell what functions they serve. He almost always wears a pair of goggles, concealing his eyes behind thick blue lenses. If he's not seen in armour, he favours light, utilitarian clothes. \nOn his back, he tends to carry a large, heavy rifle, modified with sights, bayonet and other various equipment. It seems well cared for, oiled and cleaned at all times. Besides this, he's armed with a pair of small knives, and a couple of goblin grenades.\n\n{h2:c}The Machines{/h2} \n\nZunajs favoured vehicle is Hir'fli - \"Little bat\" in his native tongue. It's a gyrocopter of goblin design, although heavily modified to fit the much larger pilot. It's in fine shape, but a mix-match of different parts and components, clearly repaired numerous times. In fact, with the amount of repairs made, one might wonder if any of the original machine is still left. \nThe machine is armed with a few basic weapons, a gun in the front and a few bombs attached underneath. It has been painted and decorated in a more tribal fashion, with bat wings and bat-themed paint, and a set of sharp teeth surrounding the front propeller.  \n\nBeing an accomplished hoarder, Zunaj possesses an entire garage of various land-based and flying vehicles (and a small jet-propelled canoe). They all see use now and then, when a job calls for more specialized tools, but the gyrocopter is his favourite.  \n",

His armor fits him well, there is little scarring on his face, the horrible scar on his throat drawing attention away from the lesser ones, but you can see by his wrinkles that he has had a hard time during his life. His scar is only visible when his cowl/mask is down.\n\n{h3:c}Weapons of note{/h3}\nShadowfang. A sword made of black steel, which is concealedby the gently drifting purple Shadow energy that moves across the blade. It lashes out with small tendrils at anything that nears it. The energy parts like fog when Mathew  touches the blade, it seems to be aggresive towards all except this forsaken man.\n\nDawnhaven dagger. A gift from a future father-in-law Astran Dawnhaven. The blade itself is of fine Thalassian Steel, magnificently balanced, and the handle consists of sturdy Thalassian oak, wrapped in lynx leather. The pommel carries a finely cut ruby, with a small fire dancing inside. The sheathe is made from the same soft lynx leather. (Worn under the flap of Mathew's cloak, semi-concealed and not used often. A treasured posession, it seems)\n\n{h2:c}History{/h2}\nMathew hails from a place named Darrowshire in what is now known as the Eastern Plaguelands.\n\nHe fled Darrowshire during the attack it was under in the Third war. He lived a few years alone in the wilds, using what was taught by his parents to survive before he died to unknown causes.\n\nWhen he was risen from his eternal slumber by the Cult of the Damned to be used as their private assassin, something went wrong and he managed to retain free will. The Cult manipulated Mathew into thinking he was assassinating evil people when in reality it were people that were a possible problem for the Cult's plans.\n\nAfter serving for a few years, Mathew decided to do some research on one of his targets, a Forsaken woman that seemed too harmless to be as evil as the Cult claimed she was. Mathew didn't carry out his task when he found out who the woman really was and he quit then and there. He befriended the woman and she referred him to the Hand of Agony as a worthy cause. Mathew requested to join and since then, has gotten a lot better as a person while serving the Queen. He's been working on his trust issues and the unrest in his soul.\n\nHidden deep beneath his armour lies the Emblem of the Forsaken. Scarred deeply and cruelly into his chest where his heart lies\n\nHe has been serving with the Hand for over three years now.\n\n{h3:c}The Cult of the Damned{/h3}\nThe Cult of the Damned raised Mathew and he was their soldier and assassin for a long time.\n\nOut of a group of thirty 'recruits' that were put through training, only five survived. The trials included gruelling exercises for stealth, manipulation, forgery, skills of assassination, murder, interrogation, etc.\n\nFailure (read also: being the one who did the worst job) at any of these tasks resulted in a punishment enacted by the rest of the squad. Being ripped limb from limb with bare-hands by your friends, being buried alive for a full week, being the subject for the next day's torture lessons, lovely things like these.\n\nAround fifty confirmed kills in their name, before he learned of their trickery. 20 men, 20 women and 10 children.\n\nDuring this time, he earned the nickname \"Reaper\" due to his cruel nature and how he used fear and terror to horrify his targets before killing them in brutal fashion.\n\n{h2:c}Family{/h2}\nAlexander (Father): A hunter who gathered food enough for his own family and sold some to fellow villagers and sometimes traders. He knew how to fight and was an honorable man who loved his family very much.\n\nMelissa (Mother): A housewife who took pride in raising her children right. She was a runaway girl who had fought many battles in the army when she first set foot in Darrowshire, where she decided to settle down.\n\nFrederick (Older brother): You would think of him as a proper soldier if you'd ever seen one. Honorable, disciplined, he follows orders, but he also thinks for himself.

Underneath his mask is a gruesome collection of old, healed scars that cover the majority of his mouth, chin and bottom half of his cheeks.\n\nHis hair while not strange is still rather unique for a Sin’dorei, he has medium length, metallic silver hair that’s kept in a shaggy yet tidy style.\n\nArc’s skin shares the same complexion as his chin,  his entire body is covered in gruesome but healed scars, he makes a habit of covering as much of his skin in clothing as he can, so it’s once again a rare sight to see his horribly scarred skin other than his neck.\n\nArcenius’s right arm and left leg have been replaced by mechanical prosthetics, both are made from bronze coloured metals and leather with glass in areas, bright blue runes are seen in areas alongside lights that escape parts between the metals.\n\nHis shoulder is large and protruding outwards, his mechanical arm is very bulky and easily noticed, he does not hide it under clothing.

The lights can still be seen behind his leather gear, shining through the material and from his ankle down the mechanical parts can be seen, including his mechanical foot. \n\nArcenius does not lack in the style department on his outfit, it is composed of dark brown and black leathers with copper and bronze coloured metal plating in areas, his clothing covers almost all of his skin except for his neck and upwards, even then he wears a jacket with a flicked up collar and tie, distracting most from his scars.. His outfit has been made to fit and his accessories match, including his metal padded boot.

For most of the time, he stands straight or with his shoulders very slightly slumped forward. His state of Undeath has visibly marked him over the years. While decay is kept away from his body and there are no bones exposed, it is a condition that Faust is unable to deny. His skin is extremely pale, lacking any natural color or feeling of warmth to it. What some may consider an unsettling feature are his intently glowing, yellow eyes set in gaunt looking features. More than often he appears to be someone either visibly tired or somber. There are deep, dark shadows permanently visible on the Forsaken’s face. Dark, almost black hair is always kept in the best possible condition and is combed towards the back of his head, without any loose strands going in unwanted directions.\n\nThe damage to both of his cheeks has been recently repaired leaving slightly discoloured flesh as well as stitching marks to the sides of his face. As a result Faust’s expressions, if shown, appear far more natural than before. \n\nThe hands of the Undead are always bound by layers of bandages. These tend to, at times, loosely hang from his arms or even get tangled. More often than not, the general smell of antiseptic and herbs accompanies him. \n\nUsually dressed in a light and comfortable outfit, this man has quiet and light footing. However the chains that he uses as a weapon always clang quietly in a characteristic manner when he moves. In addition, the equipment of this Undead always includes a large, enchanted medical bag. \n\n\n{/col}\n\n{p:c}--------------------------------------------------------------------------------{/p}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758826368145424424/759412870084689921/Faust.jpg*Faust portrait (done by artbreeder) - missing stiching marks on his face}\n{link*https://alexdreamart.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/twins-of-shadow-and-light-72.jpg*Faust art - person on the right}\n{link*https://alexdreamart.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/faust-by-alex-dream-300-dpi-3.jpg?w=1200&h=*Faust art - backstory}\n\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/240046*Argent Archives profile}\n\n\n{p:c}--------------------------------------------------------------------------------{/p}\n\n{col:ffffff}Name:{/col} Faust Lightwhisper\n \n{col:ffffff}Titles: {/col} Heart of the Forlorn Order\n\n{col:ffffff}Occupation:{/col} Medic\n\n{col:ffffff}Age:{/col} Adult\n\n{col:ffffff}Gender:{/col} Male\n\n{col:ffffff}Publicly known facts/rumors (if one was to research)::{/col}\n \n- First records about Faust Lightwhisper mention him being accepted into Royal Apothecary Society as he proved to be a very skilled alchemist and medic.

But after four years working different Mercenary jobs,\nHe eventually became a humble, kind and generous man who was quite very loyal to his employers and mercenaries.

He is also a ladies man who has married twice with four children.{/p}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-8:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:59ff6d} Lack of Intelligence and cowardness {/col}{/h2}\n{p:c}{col:59ff6d} Xian was quite the reject when he first came to the Eastern Kingdoms All those years ago.

Some treated the boy with respect while some didn’t.\n\nAt 25 years, Sun was wounded by a Hozan chieftain but was saved by his son Xain who in turn killed the Chieftain with his father's sword. After this, Sun retired from being the Captain and settled down with his son.\nThree months later Jinjing was permitted to leave the household as often as she wanted to support her family.\n\nAt 28 years, Xian convinces his parents to let him go with the other Islanders to visit the world. His father, not trusting outsiders, was hesitant  at first, but agreed,  but his mother protested only to agree when she couldn't convince  Sun otherwise. \n\nWith a Hug from his father and a kiss from his mother he left with the rest of the pandaren for the eastern kingdoms.\n{/p}\n",

This strange, grey vulpera is surprisingly built, often leaned over a bar-counter kept to himself.\n\n  Fingers will be lost if an attempt is made to \"pet\" his visage.  \n\n  Typically wearing garb for easy maneuverability, the towering vulpera carried himself about with a palpable arrogance.

He despised the advantage of strength so many held over him, despite how much he trained...so in the inky blackness of night atop Kun-lai summit, he delved into the scrolls and discovered the \"Mogu arts\".  They were not martial prowess when the pandaren held their uprising, he discovered the secret towards their self induced petrification, utilizing the \"flesh-shaping\" magic to forge his fists into solid stone during his attacks...though there was a deeper power.  \"Subjugation\" was a strange technique where one could sap the strength of their opponent, bringing them to their knee's or as the name suggests...\"subjugate\" them.  His indulgences in these studies were never completed, for he was discovered, cast out of the order.  Never having found the key to the strange second Mogu art, he scours pandaria for their instructive texts, that is when he's not fixated on disrupting the alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h2:c}A glimpse{/h2}\n\nBurning.\n\nFires licked his fur as he awoke, a similar vulpera far smaller than him gone from his grasp.  Desperately calling out to family, his struggle out of the carcass of his caravan led him to the feet of a lumbering dwarf. \n\nClasp iron chains.\n\nWhethering his fur away, everything was gone.  Watching vol'dun melt into the ocean and night.  Voices of kin wailing under deck.\n\nPandaren.\n\nStrange creatures lift him up, a mess of mud and fur, guided onto his feet, and shown how to fight.  Inner peace?  Can't.\n\nExile.\n\nShunned by his teachers, students of his same order averting their gaze from his as he left.  I have what I need, not what I want.  Alliance blood.",

However if you look past all the unkempt hair and dusty clothing she does look beautiful, in a very symmetrical tomboyish sense. Her skin, naturally on the more tanned side of what you would expect for a blood elf, is made even darker by the regular exposure to sun.\n\nShe tends to wear clothes for their practicality, rather than their appearance. They are almost always covered in dust, grass stains and sometimes dried blood.\n\nShe walks energetically, with a spring in her stride that makes it seem like she's always just about to start running.

You could have been throwing punches at eachother one minute and she'll offer to buy you a drink the next.\n\nThe term \"raised by wolves\" would be very much in place here. Spending a lot of her formative years away from civilisation has lead to a shortage in acceptable behaviour and a bit of a disconnect with her own racial identity. She might be very social in nature but is prone to stepping over boundaries that get her in troublesome situations.\n\nShe appears to have an affinity for trolls, perhaps because they were the people she had most contact with throughout her childhood.",

What do you do with babies? Evidently, you teach them how to shoot and skin a crocolisk. Alati's upbringing consisted mostly of following her mom around carrying a stack of furs, looking for lost arrows and being left to fend for herself in the wilderness occasionaly. Luckily her mother's lynx, Rhudra, had a bit more in terms of motherly instinct so she managed to survive her childhood years with relative success, albeit a little lacking in the socially acceptable behaviour department. Rhudra ended up enjoying the child's company much more than the mother's so when the mother was arrested for murder in broad daylight smack dab in the middle of Silvermoon, she very easily chose to remain at Alati's side rather than be a loyal pet.\n\nThe murdered man was apparently the one responsible for Alati's existence, as she was soon informed. She attended his funeral more out of courtesy than any particular grief, but as fate would have it, it was there that she met the first person she experienced actual attachment to. The fellow was young, had the same sharp jawline and the same straw blond hair as her, and was considerably more intoxicated than she'd ever been. His name was Redoul and he turned out to be her half-brother. Even though he was a general trainwreck she thought he was an alright guy and offered him to join her on the road, as she really had nothing to do but continue her mother's trade. He agreed. They've been in touch for some years now and although they don't always travel together anymore, they are on quite good terms.",

The Sunwell is a saving entity, a grace and power that sustains us to near immortality. The Light, an energy source, feeds our Sunwell, nourishes it, provides us with the means to the end. To worship the Light is to worship water, it is pointless and strange, yet appreciation of water is certainly normal. To this end, worship of the Sunwell itself is all that makes sense. Harnessing the power we have access to is the birthright of the Blood Elves, and cowardice exists in those that hide away from the Arcane and the Sunwell's radiance. It is no coincidence that the Sunwell beams upward to the heavens above. We should seek consolation in our hub of energy and keep it in our hearts at all times, for this sacred font of boundless resource shall sustain us forevermore.",

The risk of death during her training and transformation was high, but her determination and help from the illidari pushed her through many defeats and serious injuries.

Though a bit quiet at times she is often seen with a smile on her face and is happy to speak with friends and strangers alike, and despite being someone who is acquainted with the more darker kinds of magic she is  a very friendly soul to who treats people with kindness.\n\nAs a result of her time as a slave dancer Arra can be just as seductive as she is friendly often speaking in well-mannered and sometimes suggestive tones without even realizing it as it is something she has been thought to do often. She also relies quite heavily on physical contact to show trust, things like a friendly pat on the back or shoulder, handshakes, hugs and sometimes even some light massaging.\n\nArra tries more often than not to find more diplomatic solutions to conflict first as she is not a skilled fighter even with her magic’s and relies more on words or manipulation to survive, something she picked up from her old master.\n\nDespite her kind nature Arra does carry some darker thoughts with her due to her losing her family and being mentally abused as a slave. Having been left powerless to protect her family from death and enslavement and then being manipulated and betrayed by her supposed caretaker has left Arra with an inferiority complex that she constantly tumbles with, causing her to seek power in any form that she thinks she can control and takes comments about her abilities to heart. Due to her lack of skill in combat however Arra is more often than not beaten into a pulp reinforcing the idea that she needs more power, not only to defend herself but more importantly to protect those close to her. \n\nThis frustration can sometimes boil over and Arra’s magic runs wild often seen as bluish shadows surrounding her entire body. In this state her personality grows more choleric and her words are filled with anger and frustration and she can at times even sound mocking. Though this state doesn’t affect Arra’s performance in battle much it does make her more aggressive and seemingly more confident in her abilities. This is at the same time her biggest weakness as she lets her emotions take over her otherwise calm judgement. \n\n",

					["HI"] = {
						["TX"] = "\n{h2:c}Backstory{/h2}\n\n\nArra’s caravan was attacked by Sethrak and most of its members were killed or sold as slaves. Arra herself was sold to a wealthy Sethrak woman who saw her as an object of value, a value that could be increased with proper care and maintenance. She gave Arra clothes, food and a place to sleep and in turn Arra would be her servant, though she didn’t say exactly how Arra would serve her at first only that she had to follow her commands.\n\n\nThe first few weeks Arra’s new mistress helped her regain her strength as the Vulpera was very weak from her time in the harsh conditions of the slave pens. Though she was uncertain what her mistress’s motives were Arra wouldn’t deny herself food that was served to her on a platter, even if it was from a Sethrak. Soon enough Arra’s strength returned and not long after her life as a servant began proper.\n\n\nFirst she was told and taught to do simple things like cleaning and cooking. Cleaning was simple enough raging from dusting to scrubbing floors but cooking proved to be a bit of a challenge for Arra as she was so used to barely scraping by when it came to food out in the dunes, now she had to make food for Sethrak and had a lot more ingredients, fresh ingredients on top of that to work with. But with hard work she eventually got accustomed to this change and became a decent chef.\n\n\nNext up on the list was proper hygiene something that wasn’t exactly a foreign concept to Arra but the best she had gotten before was perhaps a dip in an oasis if she was really lucky, Now she was told to bathe in hot water, use different oils and sometimes different flowers that made her fur smooth and smell of floral. This according to her mistress was the most important thing Arra had to do every day before anything else as how she looked was reflected by her owner’s wealth.\n \nThis cleaning routine is something Arra is still doing every day even after getting her freedom back as it has more or less have become ingrained into her mind and she can become very uneasy if she hasn’t washed herself in a while.\n\n\nLastly Arra’s mistress taught her how to entertain, primarily through exotic dance but also music as both tend to be used together. While she was very uncomfortable with the idea at first dancing in general became something Arra enjoyed exotic or not.\n\n\nThis was Arra’s status que for a while spending most of her days serving her mistress in whatever way she saw fit and even though Arra missed her family and freedom she had seen how cruel the Sethrak commonly was towards her people, treating them as “pets” or working them to death so to ensure her own survival she did as she was told. \n\n\nSometime later however Arra found out why her mistress had treated her so well and taught her these things. She was an investment, a pretty doll to be toyed and played with and something her mistress planned to sell off to the highest bidder either as a plaything or to someone who bred her kind for more slaves. It was at that moment Arra realized how brainwashed she had become, she had blindly been serving initially out of fear but later in the hopes that her mistress was a good person, but there was no love or kindness behind her actions only greed. But she was the only person Arra had left. \n\n\nFortunately the Horde arrived in Vol’dun and freed the Vulpera from the Sethrak’s oppression before her mistress plan could come to fruition, and seeing her world of wealth crumble before her very eyes broke her down completely. Despite feeling betrayed and now mentally abused by her owner Arra couldn’t bring herself to harm her mistress as she owed her life to the snake woman despite the ulterior motives she had for her actions. Telling her now former owner to get out and run to safety with the rest of the upper class citizens Arra grabbed her mistress’s old Serpent staff and fled during the ensuing battle. \n\n\nSometime later Arra caught word that some of her people had begun to leave Vol’dun to join the Horde as thanks for their help. She joined up with one of the many caravans that was traveling towards Kalimdor and the capital city of the Horde. Ogrimmar. \n\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}\n\n{h3}Chapter One{/h3}\n\nShortly after arriving in Ogrimmar Arra met a group of fellow Vulpera calling themselves the Southwind Nomads who invited her to join them. Though initially unsure of what use she would be to them Arra soon found her place within the group as one of their mystics and traveled with them for a while. Their time mostly spent exploring and traveling to different cities and marketplaces, selling things they made themselves or found during their travels. \n\nUnfortunately the group eventually dissolved and Arra once again found herself alone looking for some sort of purpose or use for her skills.\n\n\n\n{h3}Chapter Two{/h3}\n\nAfter about a month of looking around in Ogrimmar Arra ran into someone that offered to teach her how to improve her magical abilities along with work that would earn her some decent coin in the meantime. Arra accepted the offer and signed a contract with the undead warlock and was scolded by them shortly after for signing without reading the contents of it. \n\nIn the weeks that followed Arra worked for the company her new teacher was a part of, a company mainly run by goblins called the Copper Street Solutions but she also fund fellow Vulpera and other races within the company. The company itself focused mainly on working as hitmen, deliverers of different goods, explores, but Arra found out later that the company leaned a little on the criminal spectrum as well as they had to do some dirty work from time to time. Arra initially helped the company out because her teacher told her to as that was a part of their contract and in return she would be taught the ways of magic starting with shadow magic as she had experience with that. But she eventually grew quite fond of the members of the company during their many missions. \n\nEverything was well for a few weeks  and Arra’s days consisted mostly of working for the Copper Streets and studying under her new master, but her studies was abruptly put on hold when her teacher got accused of having a contract with a demon lord and got banished from Ogrimmar and eventually a bounty was put on his head.\nStill Arra was able to keep in contact with her teacher trough the grimoire he had given her and her studies continued outside any of the horde capitals. \n\nUnfortunately it was not meant to last and Arra’s teacher was hunted down and killed forcing Arra to continue her studies on her own, and even though she enjoyed her time with the Copper Street Solutions Arra ultimatly decided to take her leave from the company feeling that she had gotten enough experience to handle herself.\n ",

Little is known about his time in the Dark Horde with the exception of a few accounts by the Dark Iron Dwarfs.\n\nAfter that though there was little sightings of Mardock, he did not appear again till after the fall of Rend Blackhand where he was spotted leading raiding parties across the wetlands,Twilight Highlands and Redridge Mountain.It’s speculated he was following the orders of one Malkorok during these times but the leadership of the Blackrock Clan was still disputed so this is unclear.\n\nDespite numerous complaints from Horde Leadership the Blackrock Clan members were granted amnesty via a warchiefs decree (decree given by Garrosh Hellscream) due to this Mardocks crimes as a member of the Dark Horde have been forgiven and removed from his file.\n\nDespite being given a chance to join the Horde and the Korkron by Hellscream it appears Mardock did not take his offer and instead left to pursue privateer work, why so is unclear. Despite this It appears he made decent contacts among the Steamwheel Cartel and may of used these to aquire a Mercenary status within the Horde which has granted him limited accsess to Horde territories after the fall of Hellscream.\n\nHe did request to join the Horde at a later time but was denied on the ground's of past deed's within the Dark Horde, Warlord Greya who oversaw his application committed \"You have been granted extraordinary favour for a warrior with your reputation...the fact you were allowed to keep your head is a miracle unto itself. But if you think I would allow the Horde to be sullied further by allowing a dishonourable monster like you to walk among our ranks you a greatly mistaken!\"\n\n\n",

But I cannot forget the cause, the reason why these beasts must die.\n\nJournal Entry 521;\nI finally found it, the quarry I've been searching for. Proto-drakes are nothing in comparison to these great beasts. True drakes, those who share the image of the damned aspects. There is a young green dragon I've been tracking for for a couple of days now, tomorrow I will strike. \n\nJournal Entry 522;\nHah! Finally a worthy opponent at last. This is how I shall earn my right to feast in the great halls of Odyn. These are the opponents that will hone my skill to match the Valarjar! The green drake I have slain was but a young one, but it did a number on my armor, and managed to damage my leg. I will need to get it fixed, I might even talk to an old friend about some new armor... maybe even incorporate this dragons jaw, start a trophy collection.\n\nJournal Entry 582;\nFinally, my armor is ready. Roric did a fine job, as always. The jaw of my ''first'' prey now serves as my own, well, as long as I wear this helmet anyhow. I told Roric to leave two slots in for a couple of horns, and upon request he made it so. Maybe I shall hunt a red one this time, I hear their horns are bigger.\n\nJournal Entry 590;\nI have found the Red dragonshrine in Dragonblight, I shall set up camp nearby, and prepare to track the first drake I see flying from the shrine.\n\nJournal Entry 594;\nI was about to charge headfirst into that bloody shrine, I grew so bored of waiting. It seems I need to work on my patience a little bit at the very least... I saw a drake flying of to the west, towards wintergrasp. I guess that is where I will be going next.\n\nJournal Entry 601;\nAfter tracking that drake for just under a week I found it resting in the mountains. It's easier to track flying creatures than one might expect. I refused to strike it while it was down, resting and regaining its strenght, and instead I waited around, and challenged it to a fight once it had regained its strenght and was prepared to fly. We fought an epic battle, but upon wounding it severely it attempted to flee. I leapt upon its back and finished the job. I have retrieved the horns I was after, but it seems I will be stuck here for a while, the landing broke my legs, though the armor held up well, the bloody boots, enchanted by that clever witch, seem to have no weight as I wear them, but upon impacting the ground it created such a shockwave that it must have the actual weight of a boulder. I shall have to use this to my advantage... and try not to break my legs in the process. I had not really thought of it before.. but the boots... they leave footprints even in solid stone. Let's hope someone sends assassins, not like they could fail to track me at the very least. They could be used for a little fun afterwork massacre.\n\nJournal Entry 605;\nI've been taken back to the horde encampment in Wintergrasp, and in return for their help I have enlisted my help in the next battle to take back control of the area.\n\nJournal Entry 622;\nWe have taken Wintergrasp, and the alliance prepares to take it back, but by then I will be gone. I recieved good payment, and sighted a blue drake not too long ago. I saw it flying south west, presumably towards Coldarra.\n\nJournal Entry 633;\nThe blue drake was indeed flying towards Coldarra, and I found it resting. It seems to be an adolescent one, no matter, it should still pose quite a fight. I wait nearby for it to regain its strenght. No point in slaughtering those who will not even attempt to fight back.\n\nJournal Entry 635;\nThe drake tried to flee the battle before it had started... such cowardice! Death was too good, but it was necessary for my plans. I shall bring the skull back to the witch. She should be able to enchant my armor, drawing strenght upon the skull. It's only fitting, as the blue dragon flight is all about magic, right..?\n\nJournal Entry 642;\nThe witch reluctantly agreed to enchant my armor using the skulls latent powers, she thought my practice to be savage and cruel. Is she right? Afterall... it wasn't the drakes that caused... the proto-drakes are my true enemy, right? Am I working towards the cause still? Am I lost, in need of a guide?\n\nJournal Entry 692;\nDamn them all. Those godsforsaken blacks tried to take me out with clever disguises as merchants and a dagger in the back. Had I not been undead, I would be dead. They fled during my berserker rage. Three of them, black as night, flying to the north. I shall track them down. Cowards, the lot of them. I shall punish them for their insolence. My steel WILL strike them down.\n\nJournal Entry 712;\nDead. Every. Last. One. All of them attacked at once, to think they could not take me on in a three to one fight is just pathetic. Their scales seem quite alot more resilient than other drakes though...\n\nJournal Entry 749;\nRoric has fashioned me a new shield, elementium to match the rest of my armour, and using the dragonscales I collected from the black dragons, he has coated my shield and hauberk with an extra layer of protection. It doesn't look half bad either...\n\nJournal Entry 967;\nI am currently tracking a storm drake, these drakes, unlike others seem to have a connection to the elements. Perhaps fashioning a sword out of their claws could make for a powerful weapon...\n\nJournal Entry 978;\nThe dragon was larger than I expected... much larger. It had been tortured by the damned Tideskorn, they tried to turn it into a weapon... it backfired horribly. I can do nothing but laugh at their ignorance. Whatever that drake endured, it has now been put to rest, I hope it may find peace. It has been my strongest foe to date. I see why the Valarjar hold such respect for them. I shall leave Stormheim with my trophy, and leave these glorious drakes in peace. I shall ask Roric to fashion me a weapon out of the spine, and see if I can get the witch to help me once more...\n\nJournal Entry 998;\nRoric and the witch both agreed to help, and we forged a sword from the giant spine of the drake I fell. The power inside the sword is unquestionable. It surges with lightning. I can call upon it... Like the shamans do... but still it is different... I don't call on the elements, nor do I hear any elements answer any call. No... this power is wielded somehow else. \n\nJournal Entry 1001;\nI will continue to master this newfound power I have found in my sword, and hopefully find new, innovative uses for it in combat. I have learnt how to call upon lightning blasts, and thunder. I have also found a way to power my boots up, through skull and sword, to release electric shockwaves at will.\n\nI have given it much thought, and I think this will be my last entry in this journal. I have but one more foe to hunt down... A bronze drake. But they are so much more elusive than the other dragon flights... being able to impact time is certainly a trait to fear. Whatever should happen to me, should I prevail or die, it matters not. This is the final written words of Aldwin Gravedancer... I am Dragonbane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-",

It’s normally always out of view, out of sight from most people who simply don’t know it’s there.\n\nEnchanted satchel: Normally always carried on the Doctors person, often under his coat hanging from his side by the strap is a worn dark brown satchel. It looks scuffed beyond its years, multiple compartments and pockets on it’s outside. Although if one was to look inside, they’d see nothing but an empty void of space. Alvard normally pulling out things that just…shouldn’t fit.\n\nEnchanted lantern: Hanging from Al’s belt is often a simple black metal lantern. Completely metal all the way around, besides one glass window on it’s front, scuffed and hard to see through. Inside is a flickering flame, dancing to an unheard tune. No matter the situation, the flame never seems to dim or go out, even if one tried to put it out themselves nothing would seem to happen, it’d just roar back to life in a matter of seconds.\n\nEnchanted ring: Sitting around one of Alvards fingers is silver ring, given to him by a mage.

A goatee adorns his narrow chin, a slightly darker shade of blond than his hair. On his face is also trimmed sideburns, scruffy and uncombed now in death. Alvards hair itself is a golden blond, darkened now ever so slightly in death. It’s swept back and slick, tucked behind his ears to keep it under control. Although a few strands have managed to worm themselves free, hanging down by the side of his face.\n\nOne thing that’s rather noticeable if he’s lacking his thick black gloves, is that Al is missing the tips of his fingers. Now where his nails and fingers used to be are razor sharp bone claws.

Although the ends are the only places he hasn’t attempted to sew up. The only true accessory of colour adorning it, is a red cross embroidered into the shoulder, along with a band of white cloth it sits upon.\n\nAlmost constantly covering the doctor’s cold dead hands are a set of pure black thick leather gloves. The ends of the fingers are protected by metal covers, preventing Alvards bone claws from tearing through and for good reason. It’d be a horrible tragedy if he accidently sliced open a patient or ally, most likely getting them infected.\nLucky the gloves are always kept clean and washed, as if they were his own hands. Being undead doesn’t excuse him from simply surgical hygiene! \n\nFinally, on the doctor’s feet is a pair of thick black boots. The toes are metal capped, matching his gloves. A small rune would sit on each of the boots, on the heel. Although beyond that, there is nothing special about them, they look rather new compared to his outfit itself.\n",

She tries to chat and be social, hoping to help the people she lives with. \n\nShe adores children, her words and expressions making her a motherly figure to almost anyone. Cooking and baking tend to be a therapeutic escape, often she will walk round with some baked goods; no doubt trying to offer them out to friends or kind strangers.\n\nShe enjoys her job, her tailoring has made her a seamstress to many noble ladies.

Oftentimes they are hidden by a pair of gloves, though; tucked away from sight.\n\nHer frame is that of an average sin'dorei woman. Tall, lean, imposing; not much different from the dozens of others who probably never lifted anything heavier than a hairbrush in their entire long lives, or remembered to eat often enough for that matter.\n\nHer voice is soft with a husky undertone; soothing, yet full of determination, even dominance. It's a perfect match with the solemn, serious expression that seems to be permanently stuck on her face.\n\n\nVisible items: \n\n- A gold band with a red jewel sits around her ring finger. For some reason she has a habit of covering it with her right  hand when sitting down in a park or having a conversation with strangers.\n\n- A ring with a big black rock on it on her right hand.\n\n- A small leather satchel hangs from her belt on the back side.

The things that others, especially paladins and priests, avoid. Anything that has a possibility to empower someone or something. He has also raised his fair share of undead. Mostly just zombies. But, he is progressing.\n\nMaximilien was once wandering around Northrend. Spent time researching and hiding from Alliance forces and those who are in good terms with them. He can't tell the exact moment when he slipped into undeath, but he knows that it happened in Icecrown. He noticed that something was missing and with his menial medical knowledge he noticed it. His pulse was gone, no hunger anymore, no need to breath. He was medically dead, but still kicking. However, this excited him. Now he was able to try out his research of creating a death knight.\n\nAfter Maximilien's heart froze over, he decided to seek out the Horde and the forsaken. There he would be able to be himself.

His body type could be described as lean-muscular. Standing next to an average Orc he would seem stretched out, rather than monstrously big and wide.

It is as if his muscles and skin cannot keep up with the length of his bones, hinting at something unnatural in his growth. The skin is littered with scars all over, signs of a life of battle both in the wilds and on the fields of war.\n\n{h3:c}Armor{/h3}\nHis upper armor consists of fairly big pauldrons resting on his shoulders, giving him more wideness in his look. His hands are protected by wristguards and during battle he wears a helm adorned with ram horns. His torso is covered with metal plate, which still offers good mobility of the arms.

Shown much ridicule amongst his pompous peers for being a half-breed, Kel left the elven city as soon as he was able to and lived quite a nomadic lifestyle.\n\nHaving a slight disdain for the undead due to the sacking of Quel'thalas by the Scourge, as soon as they had returned during the war against the Lich King, Kel wished to lend a hand even though he had very little training in fighting.\n\nOnce he had made his way to work amongst the Argent Crusade, he was taught the ways of the Light to aid alongside the medics. This connection to the Light, sadly, didn't last long...an event he wishes to forget made him lose his faith in it, which struck him hard as he loved healing the injured.\n\nLater on, once the continent of Pandaria is discovered and the teachings of the Pandaren monks became more known, he jumped on the chance to teach under them to find another way he could help.\n{/p}\n",

Many are stronger than him, many are also weaker. \n\nHis stance is lightly hunched, his manner of walking and standing more relaxed and casual in comparison to other warriors who walk tall and proud. Unconcerned about showing himself at his best, he shows himself at his most normal. \n\nWhile unremarkable in the most general ways, looking more at details he stands out from the majority of orcs in some points. Particularly his face. It is less wrinkled and rough-looking than one might be accustomed to among orcs. His brows are less heavy upon his eyes. And his forehead is big and smooth. The way his average tusks jut out of the corners of his mouth makes him have a very friendly look (by orc standards), nearly a light smile most of the time. Brown eyes does not show grumpiness and aggression passively, only when the situations dicate it so; but rather humoured relaxation if things are going neutral or better.\n\n\n\n{h2}History{/h2}\n\nMost of this orc's history outside the Horde is not known to plenty, but his services within the Horde may be remembered by some. \n\nHe used to be a grunt for many years, from the orc clans were freed and united, during the sailing and settling on Kalimdor, during the building of Orgrimmar, and multiple years after. It was only months after the Cataclysm had struck that he rose up in ranks to become a captain of a small section of grunts. And so he was Grunt Captain Kashgor of the Doomhammer's Wrath Grunts, who were one of multiple sections that kept watch over the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar; and the occasional mission outside the city.\n\nDuring the darker times of Hellscream's Reign, when things started to turn bad, he abandoned his loyalties and went off with a companion to venture out in the world; and stay away from the Horde and the Alliance conflict.\n\nSince then he has been back and forth with the Horde. In quieter times he has aided it in more menial duties. When the Legion invaded Azeroth, he helped run messages between the border of the Barrens and Ashenvale. \n\nAnd now as the world is in war, the former grunt has taken sides with the Champions of Azeroth, to save the world from those who would seek to destroy it. \n\n(Not Updated post-BfA)",

A red rope belt knots around his waist, the buckle sporting a large leaf against an orange background. Crudely lashed to this belt are a few pouches, some expelling exotic scents, some jingling with what can only be guessed as coins.\n\nHe walks with a measure of grace, but also a spring to compliment his bowed stance - caught between flowing steps and the bouncing trot of a long-legged bird.

His face is slight, giving him an androgynous look that may sometimes end with him being mistaken for gender. The nose is slender and leads down to a pair of thin lips, caught usually in a wry smile. His skin is smooth and holds a healthy tan, implying that he frequents the outside from preference.\n\nHis eyes are rather large and hold a pretty almond shape, rather femme in nature. In general, Daleith has luminous grass green eyes that slowly observe and take in things around him. They certainly hold warmth and perhaps to some, may make them more likely to warm up to him.\n\nHis hair is a lighter shade of black, with a thick fringe covering the right half of his face, heavily obscuring his vision on this side. The rest is cut to just under chin length and tucked behind his right ear. It appears extremely healthy as it holds a great shine and volume to it. He must take great care of his hair.\n\nHis figure is lithe, still seeming rather slender, quite thin yet showing enough muscle to suggest he is physically active. Monk training has assured him an athletic if lanky look, at least. Daleith would be surprisingly heavy for such a thin frame, potentially confusing anyone whom would have need to lift him. His gait when walking is very casual, mostly seeming apathetic to the things surrounding him.\n\nDaleith's voice is unsurprisingly quite smooth, with a very flowing tone. Despite the silkiness it holds, the image is often ruined by the bluntness and slang that he so commonly uses. Whilst it sounds slightly feminine, it can be recognised as the voice of a male. He does sing well, often told that his voice is pleasant to listen to and quite unique sounding.\n\nThere is a slight aura around him of that of a chi user.{/col}\n\n{link*https://file.toyhou.se/images/2120438_fiGdZGSJAxyGUXi.png?1476191622*Waist up}",

After the defeat of Deathwing and the discovery Pandaria, Arnatha joined the Horde fleet to Domination Point, where she saw the madness of Garrosh Hellscream grow and then joined Baine and Vol'jin's rebellion against the 'True Horde'.\n\nAfter Garrosh's defeat, Arnatha left militart life behind until the third invasion of the Legion. She joined a warband that was tasked in assaulting Legion strongholds across the Broken Isles. During one mission, something went horribly wrong and Arnatha and two other soldiers were the only survivors. Fortunatly, the war against the Legion would soon be moved to Argus and most of the Legion forces on Azeroth were either defeated or have retreated back to Argus. Arnatha later then, reluctantly, joined the Fourth War, where she quickly grew disgusted towards Sylvanas' ways and joined Saurfang's rebellion.\n\nAfter Saurfang's death and Sylvanas' 'dethroning', Arnatha indefinitely left the Military life behind and became a full on mercenary.{/col}",

Truly gargantuan, Argyro Silverhoof casts a long and terrible shadow over most that look upon him.

His arms, swooping low with each ponderous step, are packed with eyewatering musculature, raw, savage power festooned by a thick layer of dull, argent fur. His hands are padded similarly, rough as sandpaper and big enough to crush the skulls of smaller races like walnuts.\n\nHe is outrageously clumsy, perhaps hinting at a lack of coordination or more likely a complete disregard for whatever -- or whoever -- might stand before him. The slow and blunderous gait causes the compact fat of his well-fed belly to wobble.\n\nFacially, the tauren is utterly hideous. A once noble and intelligent bovine profile has since been beaten into a ruined and tortured shape. Argyro's snout, black and glistening with moisture, is crooked from repeated breakages, and his heavy, pelted jowels are lined with shallow scars and the pits of cruel arrowheads. Eyes like two small silver coins, pale and stark, twinkle with a dark and animal cleverness. From out a mouth slathered with idiots drool potrude pestle-sized teeth stained yellow, and when the tauren pulls back the thin black line of his lips to smile, he reveals a horrific beartrap of large snapping molars, incisors and canines. His poisonously bad tempered glare affords him few friends. \n\nTo the side of the tauren's shelf-like brow are adorned his long and sturdy horns. They protrude, becoming angled, designed to shovel aside Argyro's foes with murderous headbutts. \n\nGenerally he eschews heavy metal armour entirely, finding it difficult to find armourers that cater to his taurahic frame. Instead he allows the sun to beat down on his fur, giving it a close and cloying earthy aroma. Argyro goes to war with a bag of feathered hunting javelins, but his main arm is the traditional shu'halo halberd that can sweep a section of human fighters in a single arc.",

His facial features are statuesque and well defined, his cheekbones slightly raised and his jaw chiselled. His skin is smooth and of a lighter shade.\n\nHe is fortunate enough to have a full set of evening black hair which he keeps mostly in a foxtail style with a few loose strands resting upon his shoulders, should his hair be untied it would fall down to just below the middle of his back. Upon his chin he sports a black goatee which only adds to his devilish charm.\n\nHis now Golden eyes, thanks to the revitalisation of the Sunwell, are slightly angular and have a calm aura about them.\n\nHis tall frame is complimented with a toned form, broad shouldered and with a defined set of muscles that did not come across as too bulky. This elf was clearly a strong and fit individual, but also did not seem to spend all his life pumping iron.\n\nWhen it comes to scars the elf was grateful to not have any marring his pristine face, however rippling across his back are a large set of ugly and crudely healed scars, the result of an attack by a lynx when he was but a child. Lorsterian has had a phobia of lynxes since that day.\n\nHis voice is that of a smooth baritone and carried with it the aristocratic emphasis and pronunciation of nobility.\n\nWhen it came to artistic flair the elf had a few personal tattoos upon his build, the first being a tribal ink that danced across his chest, the inks a mix of black of blood red. The second of the trio would be a line of Thalassian text wrapped around his right arm that read \"By Blood and Spirit we are bound.\" The final would be that of the Blood-Knight emblem work proudly upon his left shoulder.\n\nLorsterian was not one to wear too much jewelery, the only items being a family heirloom worn upon his neck and two rings, one gold and one silver, that identified his status as a married elf.\n",

A testament of this Orc's past of war and combat. One scar that would stand out the most at first glance is a large diagonal scar reaching from his left ear to the bottom of his lip. At the end of this scar is a snapped, jagged stump of a tusk. Along with many piercings consisting of his ears, a nose ring and a lip piercing, Varokh's body has many tattoos. Though not very visable from afar due to his dark tone, tattoos cover his arms, back and neck. His head is free of any hair. A clean shaven Orc. At times, it may be visible that hair is growing on his head and face. However, Varokh often keeps on top of keeping it well shaved.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff0e00}His attire is as dark as his himself. A towering heap of darkness in all aspects. A set of crude, dark plate clads this Orc with leathers and furs lining it for added protection and comfort. Only his torso is free of any plate, no more than a harness to protect him. This allows Varokh to move his upperbody with ease. To his liking for cleaving through his opponents. Atop his head rests an intimidating large horned helmet which has surely done its far share of ramming and impaling. The horns stained with blood of past victims. A makeshift guard is fixed upon the front of the helmet, allowing for nothing more than those fiery eyes to shoot out at you in contrast to an attire with nothing more than the theme of dark colours intended for it.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff0e00}Upon his back rests his tool of war. A large two-handed axe. Whilst his armor is crude, his axe is quite the opposite. An impressive piece of smithing that any seasoned smith could admire. Forged by Varokh himself, this axe is a token of the Blackrock Clan's gift of smithing. Many signs of wear can be seen throughout this axe from its many years of cleaving. Chipped and jagged edges from the clashing against other steel as well as bloodstains of the countless enemies that were unfortunate enough to find this axe buried within them. Despite its wear, its edge is kept as sharp as the day it was forged. One of Varokh's truly prized possessions, it is clear to see he takes good care of it. Sheathed horizontally on the back of his belt rests a large dagger, if you could call it such. The size of the blade makes it fit the discription of a cleaver rather than a dagger. An exceptional backup for getting up close and dirty.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff0e00}Varokh's history is unknown to most. It isn't a topic he enjoys talking about. However, those intrigued enough to ask him may be able to get it out of him, if he's in the mood for talking.{/col}{/p}\n\n",

The elf carries himself with an ethereal, majestic grace. He always walks in an impeccable manner, keeping his back upright and an impassive, yet determined face. While his demeanor is composed, his white eyes carry a faint shade of mischief and self-indulgence. Remethion’s face is emaciated, wrinkled, and with two dark circles surrounding his shimmering eyes. In spite of his old age, Remethion’s physique is in full health and well-trained, shaped by a life spent in the Duskwatch.\n\nRemethion’s magical aura is so potent that it is almost tangible even to those unacquainted with arcane magic. The old elf has been a conduit of raw arcane power for so long, that his very nature has merged with the arcane. When fully unleashed, his magical aura feels like a storm of burning heat radiating from a core of cold fury.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\n{p:c}{icon:achievement_thenighthold_spellbladealuriel:25}WHO ARE THE LASTARIL?{icon:achievement_thenighthold_starauguretraeus:25}{/p}\n\n«A learned society is closer to the truth and to the realm of order. And once we have attained knowledge, we’ll wield enough power to give birth to a new great civilization, whose power will know no bonds, no limitations.»  \n{p:r}-Lady Elindre Lastaril{/p}\n\nTHE ORIGINS\nA family of renown arcanists, the first records of the Lastaril mention them as members of a highborne sect who excelled at acquiring ancient relics and artifacts, Elisande's very elite.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nSYMBOL\nTheir symbol is Xarok, a mythical spellwing who saved and defended Lady Elindre Lastaril from a group of zandalari long ago. It is considered a symbol of good omen among other shal'dorei. Associated with mystical properties, the creature stands a bridge between this world and the magical one, and is viewed as a testament of the arcane prowess of the Lastaril.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTHE SUNDERING\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Astralis Lastaril and Elindre Lastaril succumbed while fighting the Burning Legion. Elindre sacrificed her life to teleport her sons in Suramar, where they would have the difficult task of rebuilding what was lost.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nSURAMAR\nAnd rebuild they did. Aesther became the head of the house while Remethion joined the Duskwatch, interested more in duty than political influence and intrigue. Over time, their devotion to Suramar would pay well, with Remethion becoming one of the finest warpmancers in the city, and Aesther serving her Grand Magistrix as Arcanist of the city.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nINSURRECTION\nDuring the civil war of Suramar, the House has lost much of his ancient prestige, and its very fortune was destroyed. Lord Aesther himself has been murdered by demons. Rumor has it, Remethion was responsible for his brother's demise.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Being one of the last uncorrupted members of the orignal Bleeding Hollow clan, he clung closely to the anchient practices of his people, learning the blood rituals of his people, though he found his true passion in hunting the deadly creatures and demons that roamed the broken world.\n\nIn his teenage years he would follow a young orc named Hellscream to the world of Azeroth. In this new world he would assist the Horde, focusing his attention on fighting the Searing Blade and other Demonic cults in the new world. The young orcs hatered for both Demonic influence was already clear at this time, however another mortal enemy would be identified before long.\nDuring the Northrend campaign, Khagra would accompany Hellscream, fighting as part of a gurilla strike force on the frozen continent, doing battle against the Scourge and the Allience. In this time he lost many comrades on the battlefield, causing a bitter hatered to form against the Allience in particular.\n\nUppon the end of the Northrend campaign, Khagra's war would not be close to over. He would continue to fight at the spearhead of Horde opperations throughout the Catacysm and the Invasion of Pandaria.\n\nIt was some time during the conflict of Pandaria that Khagra became more than just an average orc, recieving mild alchemical enhancements, using ancient blood rituals from the Bleeding Hollow, giving him enhanced sences and a slight enhancement in healing factor. These enhancements would cause him to become known as the \"Blood Hunter\". These abillities would be useful when he stood with the Kor'kron to face down the Horde traitors and defend his Warcheif. In a skrimish he was severely wounded and knocked unconcious, which would put him out of action till the end of the seige. \n\nHe would mange to free himself shortly after and join up a Kor'kron remnant, attempting to reunite with their Warcheif on alternate Draenor. However after traveling to Draenor he would become distracted by personal interests, joining up with his people in the Bleeding Hollow, learning more of his people as fighting to defend them.\n\nHowever he lost faith in them after Kilrogg consumed the demon blood again, changing sides and rejoining the Horde to bring down the new Fel Horde. He would then return to Azeroth to fight the Legion and later the Allience during the Fourth War.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His eyes were once red, his body lean and athletic from spending hours at work in his doctors surgery, and after a time where his eyes were green and his body less than athletic, it seems that life with the Bilgewater Battalion has given him muscle to match his bulk and he's even made consciencous effort to draw away from corruption. Aside from his eyes, his head seems to have taken the brunt of the toll which comes from dabbling in the fel, his face being more wrinkled and what was once a full head of hair having fled the top of his head, forming into sideburns which he struggles to keep in check. \n\nHowever, concerning his fashion sense <The next part seems to have been edited heavily> Jastor is a pioneer in good fashion sense, from his black battle ensemble with felforge ventilation to the finery which he wears when interacting with other important people, or attending fanciful functions, the problems brought about by AGING seem to slip away thanks to the Doctors impeccable style choices.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WorkshopHorde:512:256}\n\nI come from humble beginnings. Back on Kezan I lead the simple life of a Doctor after I graduated from Crapopolis U. I lived in Bilgewater Port out of my very own surgery with my family, who I unfortunately had to sell to the insurance company so that I could get tickets aboard Gallywixes Pleasure Yacht because Mount Kajaro went and blew its top whilst I was operating.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-LostIsles:512:256}\n\nHere's a holiday snap I took of the Lost Isles, ok so it was more of a traumatizing shipwreck in which I was attacked by wild animals, almost zombified by pygmies and temporarily enslaved by the Trade Prince but I got to say, the island was beautful. Until it got melted by another volcano...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n\nFor a while after the Lost Isles fiasco, I decided following the Trade Prince who had just enslaved me a week or so ago wasn't really for me. So I ran away with the Darkmoon Faire and learnt myself some warlockery. At first it was just an act, pull the imp out of a tophat, saw a voidwalker in two, but then it became something else, it became a -passion-.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Azshara:512:256}\n\nI've ended up saddled with the Bilgewater Cartel, again. It turns out that carnies don't take kindly to my response to their FALSE accusations being to give them the old finger and fly off in their dirigible. Of course they didn't really expect a guy who was once a fully qualified doctor (I still am by the way), to roll up dressed as a mad scientist. So they assigned me somewhere, let's just say my time in Azshara was short lived as it turns out 'they don't want their lumber turned into charcoal', ingrates...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Felwood:512:256}\n\nWhere did I end up? Felwood of course, where else would a Goblin warlock of my talents end up but in the back end of nowhere surrounded by the remnants of a once great empire of treehuggers and hippies, hidden away from the rest of the world to do my work.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-FelForge:256:128}\n\nBut don't you worry, ladies and gentlemen, the good old doctor still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and in this little pocket of fel infested paradise, my final trick is already in the making...",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

His mind roams freely, and countless personalities enter his memories and his thoughts\nBecause of this he will not always be found acting the part of wise mystic but sometimes more of a madman contributing to him being more of an outsider amongst his kind\n\nWhen speaking to a spirit walker one can never be truly certain that only the spirit walker responds, for they speak with the voices of the spirits..\nNor what spirit rouses him to action.\n\nDue to this, he can sometimes be found in spiritual states questionable and undesireable to others.

This dream however, came into conflict with her personal values. Teya felt that Garrosh Hellscream was too barbaric, and after hearing the horrific events of the bombing of Theramore, she felt she was at odds with the Horde, and after a battle with an unruly Garrosh apologist, Teya left her home in Orgrimmar.\n\nTeya's life became very nomadic, exploring all the corners of the isle of Kalimdor, training against whoever offered a duel. Her life became solely focused on her training, rarely taking reprieve in the beautiful scenery, hearing the tyranny of Garrosh occasionally from the citizens of the towns she passed through, fuelling her rage, and increasing the harshness of her self imposed training.\n\nReturning to Orgrimmar months later to the mistreatment of Trolls and the slavery of Tauren, Teya looked for any signs of resistance against the Orcish supremacy regime, and found plenty of it. Joining ranks with the likes of Lorthemar Theron and Vol'jin, as well as the Alliance in the siege of Orgrimmar, Teya fought against the Iron Juggernaut, and after a long battle, met her death against the might of the great machine.\n\nAfter dying to the Iron Juggernaut, Teya found herself alive once more, at her grave. Lost for words, being greeted by an undead General Nazgrim, offering Teya another chance at life as a knight of the Ebon Blade. Teya accepted and swore fealty to the Lich King, grateful for her one more shot at life, after it was cruelly taken away by the Orcish Horde. ",

She continued to train and be the best fighter that she can be until after the Sunwell was restored she started to notice changes in herself and slowly gained more magical skill and along with her sword knowledge she was sent to be tested as a Blood knight.\n\nUnlike many other blood knights she had faith before and after the sunwell was restored something her father always said to her “For every negative there is a possible, for every failure there is success and for every broken heart there is someone out there to help you mend it, you just have to have faith and believe that even though the clouds are out, the sun will shine on your life again .\n\nA question she was asked, “Why do you wish to be a blood knight.” Her answer was simple but came from the heart, because she watched her father fall in the 3rd war, and if she can help, she wishes to try and prevent others from feeling what she did, She wants to help protect and serve them physically and emotionally.

As he and his colleages peered up, they saw one star, yellow like our own fade and die, consumed by the void. The second, an energertic white star burst into green fel flame, the third was a red giant, dying of ripe old age exploding into a supernova and collapsing dormant.  He recorded the light of these stars in 3 jewels and fled the beseiged city. \n\n{h2}Coming to SIlvermoon{/h2} \nNallath and his family joined{col:2022ff} Dath'Remar{/col} and the Highborne to sail to Tirisfal and Quel'Thalas where he took up the profession of gemologist using leylines to grow \"natural crystals\" as opposed to cutting them. After a series of lucky commissions, he was comissioned to create some of the crystals that you still see in Silvermoon today. Despite the wealth and lands and wives, his prized posessions were the three jewels where the light of the three suns resided until recently.\n\n{h2}The Decline of House Endalah'nore{/h2}\nNallath had three older children who, being spoiled and entitled, bought themselves their own houses and promptly began to bankrupt their father while (insult to injury)  changing their names and breaking the large house wealthy into three separate considerablyless wealthy houses:\n\nEth'lore, \nMath'lanore\nEdlion\n\n{col:221dff}Marithol{/col} the grand daughter of Nallath and matriarch of House Ed'lion was the closest to her grandfather and gave back part of her dowry to her now penurious papa. After a disasterous experience in Dalaran, she came back truly humbled and moved into the countryside. When Nallath began to fade away she took care of him to his last.\n \n\n{h2}The Scourge of Silvermoon{/h2}\n\nThe entire houses of Eth'lore and Meth'lanore and most of Edlion were eradicated during the scourge of Silvermoon. 248 petty nobles, rangers and mages in those houses were killed by Arthas and his liches. The only survivor of a once historic house was a 30 year old elf, a baby really by elf reckoning.\n\nDath'aman is now the last scion of the house Edlion  that was completely whiped out during the scourge of Silvermoon. When that dread day came, Dath was many leagues away learning to be a courier in Stormwind. \n\nWhile he has no house to represent, he is of noble birth and carrys himself with poise and grace as one of high standing. He has inherited a condominium in Silvermoon as well as a collection of gems and naturally grown (not cut crystals). \n\n{h2}A Checkered Past{/h2}\nDath has had dark past dealing with warlocks and demons of which he is ashamed but after 5 years of being a squire for the Argent Crusade, he beleives that he has atoned for his mistakes. \n\nDath served on the front line during the invasion of Suramar by the combined elven forces but was greivously wounded during the Assault on Nighthold and was not involved in the defeat of the Legion or the fourth war, so called the Battle for Azeroth.\n\nDath is a follower of the church of the light and has never partaken in fel magic. \n",

Her chin is highly angular, but at the very tip of it it curves neatly.\n\nHer form is clearly made for a fighter of melee: An agile, muscular bodyshape. The muscles are quite clearly visible and well-packed to her body. They are not overly large like an orc would have, but more practical for smooth movements in the heat of a battle. {/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-57:64:64}\n\n\n\n\n",

He may be past his prime youth, but there is no mistake that he is strong, brave, honourable and terribly stubborn. \n\nHe walks with a heavy but proud stride, displaying a fierce presence that commands respect and will simply shoulder away anyone unfortunate enough to get in his way.\n\nCurrently wearing a heavy type of Horde-style armor, a well worn and used set but one that inspires both fear and respect. \n\nHe is tatooed with the symbol of the Warsong clan to clearly mark his roots, seen on his left shoulder if not covered. \n\nHis table manners are also awfully terrible..\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHistory: \nThe son of Kulrakh Bloodfang ,born and raised in the Warsong clan, Durgrol only had a short childhood among his clan before contracting the Red Pox. \n\nAs a result he was placed among the quarantined in Garadar. His father told him this was his test of worthiness, he would either fight through the sickness and emerge alive, strong and a member of the Warsong, or he would die, weak and forgotten.\n\nSuffice to say, this painful struggle came to build a massive wall of stubbornness with the young orc, drawing inspiration on the tales of how his fellow clan folk would spit and roar in the face of death in defiance.\n\nDurgrol did survive and crushed the sickness within himself but by that time, the Warsong clan had already passed into Azeroth and he was left with only a few of his fellow clansmen on the broken world of Outland.\n\nNot willing to give up or let himself die as the world itself once had, Durgrol joined those strong enough to fight in the defence of Garadar, using the Warsongs legendary hit-and-run tactics to push back eventual attacks from the various ogre tribes and broken draenei.\n\nWith the coming of the Dark Portal’s reopening and the reunion for the Mag’har with their green-skinned kin, Durgrol came to Orgrimmar and was amazed of how the Horde had not only survived but grown into a great force.\nDurgrol would follow the events of the Horde as the time passed and he noticed, with joy, how Garrosh Hellscream rose to power.\n\nHowever, Hellscream's true colours and nature, did much to put a huge dent in both Durgrol's pride as well as trust. \n\nThese events has left him somewhat bitter, yet he now fights with determination to preserve what remains of the Horde’s glory and honour as well as also for the preservation of a place to call home.\n\nHe is the current patriarch of the Bloodfang line, until his own son, Dragul, or daughter, Shagara, surpass him as leader of his bloodline.\n",

A beautiful elven woman who had run afoul of the law, had been running with this band for a couple of years. \n\nA young man from the kingdom of Stromgarde had also found himself on the run and fallen in with the crew. Though their stories were similar, it took the man many years before eventually convincing his beloved Alreana that they were meant to be. From this union a young boy was born.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n{col:00fbff}DESCRIPTION:{/col}\n\nAllarin Evenheart stands at a height of 6'5 feet. His physique is lean muscled and well defined, courtesy of a rough life. His hair, when grown out, is more coarse than one would expect, and often styled in one of several different ways. \n\nHis eyes glow vibrantly yellow, so much so that it can at times be difficult to see his pupils. His right eye has lost its shine.\n\nHis mixed heritage unfortunately counter-acts the so often praised elven beauty of his mothers side, leaving him with marked cheekbones, a strong jaw and slightly too plump nose and lips, the latter of which he sometimes tries to conceal by growing his beard out. Not that it does anything to hide what he is, as anyone with half a brain can tell that his ears are far too short for a full-blood Quel/Sin'dorei.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{col:27ff57}GUILD EVENT INFO:{/col}\n\nROLE: Healer - /roll 1-6 if attempting to heal someone.

This changed quickly for the young fox when Korthek's minions swept across all of Vol'dun, taking any Vulpera they could find as prisoner - dead or alive. Vale stood to defend the outpost, but fell in battle. Of the fight, he retained a dangerous memento: the Sethraki blade that had been thrust through his chest.\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-paladin-cover:256:256}\n\n{h1:c}THE LION'S MERCY{/h1}\n\nHe recalled little from the time between the attack and the first time he was able to open his eyes since the sword was plunged into his chest. The blue flags that surrounded him told him plenty though: it was a camp controlled by soldiers of the Alliance. To his surprise, he wasn't bound by chains or behind the bars of a cage. His chest wound was covered by clean bandages, and beside him lay several similarly wounded soldiers. Humans, for the most part, but some dwarves, gnomes, and other kinds he was unable to recognize.\n\nA day, maybe two later, he found himself lying awake. A hooded man with the head of a wolf - a worgen, he'd heard - spoke to a human by the entrance to the tent, in a language he was unable to understand. They both pointed at him occasionally, and he could only wonder what grizzly fate awaited him.\n\nInstead, the human walked away, and the worgen drew closer, inspecting the wounds before following the human.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe didn't attempt an escape until he was able to stand up on his own again. His escape was foiled moments after it started; by the worgen no less. He stood ready to fight his way out, despite the obvious difference in size and bulk, but the worgen simply stood in his way, an amused grin spreading across his snout. He drew a dagger - big enough to be a small sword for the vulpera - and tossed it his way, before drawing a mace of his own.\n\nThe first swing was Vale's, striking the mace's handle, to be pushed away without a hint of effort from the worgen. The wolf swung with the broad side of the mace, which the vulpera just barely dodged. As they traded blows, the worgen seemed progressively more amused, until he finally grabbed the blade and yanked it right off of Vale's hand. Bruised and tired, the vulpera could do little more than protest. As (what Vale assumed to be) a token of good will, the worgen knelt, placing a hand on the largest gashes on the fox's body. The hand shone briefly... and the pain subsided. Once the hand moved away, there was no wound scarring the fur anymore. Unsure of what to make of this, the vulpera reevaluated his options. Suddenly, his bed in the medic tent seemed better than venturing out into the sands.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nMore spars took place over the next days. He was beginning to understand the language of the Alliance's forces a little better. He could recognize specific words. More vulpera came in, and not all of them left, their injuries too great. The humans looked weary from not just the desert, but also the war. There was more to this than he'd been led to believe by Horde couriers. He understood, above all else, that the sethrak offensive grew stronger by the day.\n\nFrom books borrowed by the soldiers, he learned (from the pictures, at least) about the \"righteous\" soldiers who embraced a power called \"the Light\". When he quizzed the few who visited his tent, even less were able to give him a proper answer. Its power still fascinated him.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe wasn't sure how long he'd stayed at this camp when he fell mysteriously ill. The mender at the settlement tried his best, but nothing seemed to make the vulpera's state improve. Finally, an unorthodox solution was found: he'd been given a blade, previously wrapped in thick cloth - the blade that had struck brought him to an inch of his life in the first place. Just like that, his health improved almost overnight.\n\nThe soldiers at the camp didn't seem to like that. He wasn't sure if it was the appearance of the jagged blade, or the fact that their captive had a weapon with him all the time now. His worgen 'mentor' saw past that, for reasons beyond his understanding. Over a few more days, when Vale's Common was developed enough, they had a proper conversation. He was told more about \"the Light\", and how it was the only way he would ever be able to survive wielding the weapon. When he queried him for hints on where to start searching, the worgen grew hesitant.\n\n\"Believe?\"\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\nHe left the camp during a moonless night, when the guards were much too tired to either notice or chase him. He carried new armor and a small satchel full of supplies for the journey through the sands. The trek was nothing new to him - but it would be no less painful.\n\n\n{h2:c}{icon:inv_inscription_81_contract_honorbound:50}{/h2}\n\nThe fresh breeze of the port of Dazar'alor greeted him after days of travel, trade and bargains.\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h2}OOC Note: The dagger is of void origin, and others capable of detecting such energy can detect it too. Vale -will- lose strength after too many days without it, such is the way it has become bound to his soul.{/h2}\n",

She's no young woman, but she's no hag either.\n\nAs a result, she was always seen as the \"older, uglier one\" when compared to her younger sister, who had always adapted to the social niceties expected from the upper-crust of society with much more ease.\n\nShe keeps her blond hair tied in a bun fashioned so it will not be a hindrance to her during battle. Battle being something she has seen for many years, and has led her to collect a rather extensive collection of scars on her sun-kissed skin, the most notable of which being the one that runs vertically down her right eye, permanently closing the once shining Fel-green orb that is now hidden beneath a simple eyepatch.\n\nBesides being considerably taller than the average female of her kin, she is fairly curvateous and sports a reasonable bust that compliments a body marked by toned muscles developed after almost a lifetime of battle. More often than not, her body is encased in her suit of armour, which she sports whenever necessary, along with an expertly crafted greatsword resting inside a scabbard upon her back, and a rather simple looking dagger at her hip. \n\nDespite this, she is not opposed to more casual attire when off duty, along with a few small, simple golden rings on her long ears for decoration.",

The one remaining in its socket burns now with the renewed energy siphoned from the Sunwell to sustain his body after many long years of resorting to Fel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\FlavorImages\\BloodElfLogo-small:256:256}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValin's height would be rather average for the males of his species, standing at a comfortable height of over six feet. Six feet five inches to be precise, but who has the time to measure?\nHis body would despite of his age be in prime condition, with well-defined and trained muscles beneath his armor, which is most likely worn as a very typical Sin'dorei style of attire with striking golds and reds with base of blacks to show off wealth and social status.\n\n\nHis expression usually hard, stern and bored, as if waiting for children to cross his lawn so he can tell them to get off of it. His gaze would, when he bothers to, scan his surroundings and analyze the situation as if to determine in how much of a danger everyone in the room is of being shot at. Be it by him or more than likely an unknown assailant - a bad habit after so many long years of war and struggles for his people.\n\n\nHis overall attitude would fit well into the typicalities of his kinsmen, being an elf with a longer lifespan than most races and a usual trait of narcissism. He considers himself to be superior to many others in his line of work, which is often not without a cause... Having after all lived this long in a dangerous and backstabbing-earning work, it's almost unheard of for an assassin to live as long as he has, so usually his behaviour is not without a cause and an explanation as to why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h3}History{/h3}\n\nSome general history that's fairly easily accessible to law enforcers: \n\nEarliest records are of a Darkblade family living in relative peace in the current Ghostlands, near Windrunner Village. Apparently trolls slaughtered the place, making this man the sole survivor, yet the available information is oddly scarce and vague.\n\nValin's an old assassin, thief and jailbreaker who plagued a lot of the richer habitants of Quel'thalas, the High Kingdom, for many a long year. The spree of crimes he committed stopping for a good while when the Scourge came, led by Arthas. Temporarily joining the Farstriders as a volunteer to help his homeland against the invaders, his skills proved valuable as an expendable scout and backline disruptor to help try and slow the Scourge's invasion of High Home.\n\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, she climbed the peach tree that she always watched from her window, fell from it and broke her left arm in three places.\nAt 10 she was sent to the Shang Xi's Academy on the recommendation of her sister, who, by that time she achieved the rank of master. Jue did not enjoy her time there, being nearly twice as small as the other students of her age she was always made fun of by her peers and had a hard time keeping up with class exercises. One day, however, one of the peers and their friends who always seemed to pick on her the most took it too far, telling her that she's too weak achieve anything and she will disgrace her family's name. At that moment something in Jue snapped, attacking the bullies. Before the instructors could break off the fight, she bit off a chunk of a bully's ear and punched two others so hard they lost multiple teeth. The instructors at the academy deemed her too undisciplined and violent, expelling her.\nNot long after that incident, during a summer night, the family was awakened to loud thuds that originated from one of their storage sheds. Her father and older sister rushed down, Jue following them too, not wanting to be left out. Both her father and sister barged into the shed thinking that feral vermlings have broken into their food stores, only to find a small tiger cub. \nDespite her parents' wishes she wanted to keep the cub. Only after her sister stepped in, once more, and argued that a well-trained tiger could help with the vermling problem, and Jue would have a friend. After many hours of begging and almost crying her parents relented, letting Jue keep the cub, naming him Riu.\nFrom that night on she'd spend her time playing with the tiger and wandering around the Isle. As the tiger grew, they started to hunt down the vermlings that tormented her parents' and neighbours' farms, over time managing to rid of most of the population in the South of the Isle.\nHer explorations around the turtle became bolder, venturing to the highest peaks, and many times getting lost or stuck, needing help to bet back and almost falling off Shen-zin Su once, \n",

Etched into the left side of his neck is a burn-like smear that extends and branches out, as if trying to reach for and grasp at his cheek, and a couple of similar scars can be found on his left arm whenever the flesh of his limb is exposed: one by his bicep, another by his forearm.\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/LDPzmUb.jpg*I'len by MarcelaFreire}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546696964281073669/788121148226666556/Ilen_portrait_v2.png*Scars by Selann}{/p}",

Though it appears primarily designed for ease of movement, the presence of armoured parts suggests that it is more than capable of reducing the strain from a rough hit.\n\nAt the top, a cuirass is held beneath the tunic, strapped into place by two leather straps, and playing host to a collar that seems to curve perfectly around his neck to conceal the most unsightly part of his scars while the baggy, long-sleeves narrow down so as to fit neatly into his gauntlets. Recently, a pauldron can be seen hugging the shoulder area of his left arm.\n\nElsewhere, his legs are mostly shrouded by the skirt-like segment of the tunic.

Her frail brittle hair kept permanently up in a mohawk by a mixture of willpower and some unknown substances. Her face cracked and scarred with signs of repair, hey eyes glowing aside as any death knights does. Her chin has become a mess of scabbed and dead flesh with bits of bone sticking through. \n\nHer body under the armour is almost patchwork in view. Pieces of flesh of varying colours and even some cases subtle differences in size sewn and wired together. One must wonder, what part of the Goblin is even their original self?\n\n{h2:c}Gear{/h2}\n\nA set of relatively simple armour in overall design. Black-stained steel over chainmail rings keeps this Goblin safe. Gold trim long since dulled into a brass-like colour lines the armour with small inscriptions faded now. But a few icons of the Church of the Holy Light seem visible. Between joints is a small bit of thriving rust, mud and an unwashed nature to it all. Her helmet seems the most in good condition if only because that is what people see most, reflecting a small bit of polished metal.\n\n{h3:c}Details{/h3}\n\nA frayed tabard bearing the design of the Horde sits over her armour, its condition is that of question if it's actually threads holding it together or years of stains. Scrolls sit around her belt glowing faint displays of sickly green right next to a meat-hook looking dagger.\n\nA backpack with her at all times is filled with odds and ends. Near bursting from the seams one can see vials, jars, odd bones and even pieces of scrap. The contents of which varies and changes almost daily as things are used and then pushed deeper into the pack.\n\nHanging about her neck is a small silver chain necklace in the shape of a golden disc with a goblin face engraved into such.\n\n",

From that moment onwards Belolonis adores Northrends climate she could spend her days admiring a snowy moutainess landscape sipping on her favourite beverage dwaren ale even though it is work finding it, normally she buys it from some very \"interesting\" individuals which has acquired her some very odd friends.\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-wotlk-Icecrown:512:256}\nHouse Mournguard is very large, firstly you would have Belolonis the first born of Krearrin Morningguard and Bellen Morningguard,then you would of have Belolonis brothers Vor'lon, Kraeleron, Velendan and Alestus being the youngest.

In his final few years he can lay comfortably knowing house Mournguard has a bright future. \n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-SilvershardMines:256:128}\nBlacksmithing has always been a passion of Belolonis, she discorved this passion while admireing a ore as she bargained with a travelling trader she wasnt sure what kind of ore it was back then and now still isnt sure as she hasnt come across such a ore like the one she saw but still she remembers its distinct colour of blue in its core,the only similar ore she has found is true ore.\n\nBelolonis is also a great fan of cooking, she enjoys a strong alcoholic beverage just like anyone else but she never properly acquired the taste of wines she can stand such a taste at family balls but she would never pass a chance to pour the wine into a potted plant. Some of her Favourites include Mountaineers Ale,  Booty Bay rum, Apple Bloom cider, Moonshine. She also enjoys Zanadalri Food like Mon'Dazi and Honey pot pie. Other than that she can be found in you local tavern attacking lobster stew and some grilled squid. \n\nHer daily routine normally starts and finishes at a tavern but inbetween that she is either sampling ore or out adventuring with a racist elf Astalleron, after that she heads to the broken tusk in orgrimmar to drink, eat and reflect on the day.  \n         \n\n\nshe has also become close to the tauren and is learning about there culture. Tauren have always been adored by belolonis she admires their way of thinking and there love for the earth mother.

Even though he only carries a select few into battle, it is little wonder that more often than not he is heard before he is seen.\n\nLargely due to years of alcoholism, foul military cooking and a bad habit of never washing his mouth that stretches as far back as Archimonde's defeat at the battle of Mt.

He holds himself well, with shoulders pinned back by centuries within the armed forces. Often expressive when in a group, Rafaiel is most at ease when sharing a story or a drink with friends.\n\nHe is usually seen in clothes that are presented well; pressed shirts and trousers, or well kept dueling leathers. He maintains a precise, fashionable apperance. His weatherbeaten face is well groomed, with sharp facial hair kept precise and in line.\n\nAt his hip hangs a ceremonial Naval sabre. It is gilded, but marked with deep gouges from years of use. Of everything he caries, it is always polished and as tidy as it can be.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-Freehold:256:128}\n\n{h1:c}Background and Public Knowledge{/h1}\n\nRafaiel's military career spanned three centuries with the old Thalassian Fleet. As a High Elven captain of some renown, Rafaiel worked to maintain the shipping lanes between Qel'thalas and Kul Tiras. He enjoyed the rank of Captain for many years, and his experience of the waters in those areas is second to none.\n\nIn the years following the Fall, Rafaiel has earned himself a name as a fairly successful businessman, shipping goods from across the known world.\n\n\n{h3}{col:8190ff}\"To Absent Friends\"{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h1:c}Art{/h1}\n\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711953922654227/RafShipZiry.png?width=1156&height=676*Rafaiel working by Marcerian}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811960563386810368/811972946616647680/Tattoo_for_Rafaiel.png*Tattoo Reference by WolfjeLina}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812712072344240188/unknown.png?width=1373&height=676*Rafaiel at work - zoomed}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711838952325140/Raf_Marcerian_sketch.png?width=478&height=676*Rafaiel face sketch by Marcerian}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711888823386112/Captain-Raf-Birthday_2020-1.png?width=380&height=676*Stormy Weather by WolfjeLina}\n{link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/805076609434517504/812711864365744158/RafRender.png?width=380&height=676*Rafaiel rendered by WolfjeLina}\n",

No, I am not an orcling! I am a GOBLIN, ya know small, green, likes gold...I forget how old I am exactly, it's not something I really bothered to keep track of! Hard to describe myself really...as I change my hair colour and style often to suit my outfit! But ya know, I’m not much different from other Goblins really, I am just way more stylish! \n\nOh yea, I like taking selfies with my camera thing, mostly with my companions...so if ya want to be in a photo just ask! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_misc_book_10:40}History{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Hey…HEY! Down here *waves*. Yea now I have your attention, the name is Slacker…just Slacker…I ain’t important enough to have two names or a title. So ya probably heard of me, right? Whatcha mean no? Well lets see…most call me the worst thief in Azeroth. Why? Well…because sometimes I get caught stealing things. Like this one time I was trying to steal this jewel that I was told was hidden in the Undercity, I bought this map off a drunk Orc. I should have been suspicious as the map was drawn on what looked like a piece of toilet paper…and I think I was reading the map upside down, so I ended up in right in front of Sylvanas, whoops! I really should learn how to read maps better. \n\nLet’s see what else, oh yea cause I’m a Goblin I mostly go unnoticed when I’m not thieving that is, which means I hear things ya know? Like did you know there is no such thing as a female dwarf, honest it’s true! And I also heard that Pandarens don’t like chocolate cause it disagrees with them, at least that’s what my friend’s sister’s cousin’s gardener says.\n\nI dunno what else to put in this thing…oh yea I have a pet dog called Bandit, he follows me everywhere! Including when I go thieving…which is probably why I get caught because he likes to bark at the most inappropriate times.\n\nOh yea, and I may not look it but I can fight! Honest I can, I killed many of the Legion’s demons, yea I’m pretty awesome when it comes to things like that\n\nWell I think that’s it, if you see me say “Hi” or something, I’m nice…really I am{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:petbattle_health:40}Lil’ Buddies{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}I have three companions, a white frost wolf pup named Bandit. He found me when I was adventuring in Dreanor, he has been by my side ever since...and no I didn’t steal him if that is what you are thinking! Bandit is my bestest friend in the whole world, probably because he is one of my only friends really...\n\nThe other companion is a Robot named Blaster...he is from SPACE! At least that’s what he tells me...I found him in pieces at the bottom of this HUGE creator, I fixed him up as best as I could and his first words to me were \"beep boop beep\" which I think means \"we are friends forever\" either that or \"I have come to destroy your planet\"\n\nAnd finally, there is Kay Nine, a Robot dog a built all by myself…he may have gone through a few redesigns and reconstructions though! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:spell_tailor_mountspeedup01:40}Noble Steeds{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Yea I have a couple of other animal friends that help me get around Azeroth, they are an pair but hey they seem to like me for some reason or another.\n\nEd, oh Ed…the lovable goofball! Long story short, basically I was in Vol’dun…the big, dry desert! This Hyena kept following me and laughing at me, I have no idea why exactly but whatever. Anyways, I got ambushed by a bunch of blood thirsty Hyenas. I thought I was doomed, so I didn’t know what to do…I was gonna try and fight my way out, until Ed came outta nowhere and fought them all off! So, we became good friends, and I spent hours trying to name him, went through every name I could think of and he didn’t like any of them! When I jokingly said the name “Ed” he laughed lots, which I think meant he liked that name. \n\nFinally, we have Squish. It is probably my favourite, because it can fly…but don’t tell Ed that! So once again I was exploring…getting lost, like I do, and I decided to eat some lunch. I had just “acquired” a nice piece of steak that I was gonna cook up and this thing jumped at me! I thought it was gonna kill me! Turns out, it was hungry and wanted my steak, so I gave it my steak and it decided to hang around with me. Some say Squish is evil and stuff, but honestly Squish is very friendly and nice! And I call Squish “it” because honestly…you tell me! Is it a boy thing or a girl thing! I don’t even know how ya tell! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:ui_horde_honorboundmedal:40}The Horde{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What do I think of the Horde? It’s alright, I ‘spose. Seems like some members don’t like us Goblins, they look down on us and I don’t mean ‘cause we are short and small…We aren’t all money grabbing buttfaces, ok well some of us are…but then some of us are super awesome and cool! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:achievement_leader_sylvanas:40}Sylvanas{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Oh, you wanna know what I think about Sylvanas, well she don’t like me much and I guess I don’t like her either? I mean don’t get me wrong, she has done some great things for the Horde, made us stronger…but I dunno, as of late she is becoming like…that guy. You know the guy *breathes in and impersonates the Lich King perfectly* THE EVIL DUDE WHO SAT ON THE CHAIR OF ICE AND LIKED UNDEAD AND HATED CAKES *coughs* ugh, impersonating him hurts my throat! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_axe_2h_saurfang_c_01:40}Saurfang{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}So, you wanna know what I think about the other guy, Saruman? That’s his name, right? Oh, oooh! Saurfang is the guy people are talking about? He is one cool dude! I heard something about him getting into trouble. He is ok in my books *brings out a small book* see, says right here “Saurfang is ok”. \n\nI met him once, ya I did! So, I was exploring the world, as I do, and I walked into this horde camp just wanting to get some supplies and I bumped into him. At first, I was scared because he is a big guy and he wears some hefty armour, but he knelt down and asked me my name. I was shocked, no Orc has ever knelt down to talk to me…heck Orcs don’t talk to me much at all…So I told him my name and he asked to see my sword, he took it in his hand and advised me that “It’s a good blade, strong and well made” and then he asked me do I fight for the honour of the horde or do I fight for myself…so I was honest with him “I’ll fight anyone who picks on my friends but I ain’t about fighting or killing someone for no reason” and he patted me on the head and smiled. So, Saurfang to me at least, is a-ok.  {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:spell_misc_emotionhappy:40}Hobbies & Interests{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Ya anna know what stuff I like besides “borrowing” stuff and feeding my face with Ice Cream and Sweets until I barf? Well, I like to hang with the few friends I have (which isn’t many!) and I love to play with my animal buddies, Bandit just LOVES it when I play fetch with him! Oh, and I LOVE to go exploring and on adventures! \n\nOf course I do like to mess around with inventing things using spare parts I “find” and I also like to play guitar, yea I am a superstar! I found this broken little guitar when I was on my travels, it may not sound the best but I do enjoy strumming out a tune or two…I even wrote a song! Hell yea, its gonna be like the song everyone will be singing someday! Check it out below…{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_axe_2h_undeadguitar_c_01:40}The Fresh Goblin from Kezan!{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}Now this is the story all about how\nMy Goblin life got flipped turned upside down\nAnd I'd like to take a minute \nJust relax and sit your butt right down\nIll tell ya how I became the fresh Goblin from Kezan!\n\nOn an Island called Kezan, born and raised\nOn the race track is where I spent most of my days\nZippin' and Zoomin' being up to no good{/col}\n{col:FFFFFF}'til a giant dragon started shooting fireballs in my neighborhood\nScreamin' and shoutin' everyone runnin' around\nWonderin what to do there was no help to be found\n'til Gallywix yelled \"Gimmeh your gold and your lives will be saved!\"\nTo the bank I ran not knowin' I was about to be betrayed\nI was thrown on a boat and made slave!\n\"You belong to me now, so dontcha misbehave\"\n\nSet sail we did, Gallywix in-charge\n'till Alliance ships saw our lil sail barge\nFired at us and sank us they did\nTo the nearest island we swam and we hid\nMet a big green dude we did, his name was Thrall\n\"Follow me little goblins and there will be safety for all!\"\n\nJoined the Horde and went to Ogrimmar \nGallywix came too, to which we all thought bizzare!\nWe pulled up to the gates about 7 or 8\nI yelled to Thrall \"yo, thanks smell ya later\"\nI looked at the City I was finally in\nTo sit on my butt as the fresh Goblin from Kezan! {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:ability_ironmaidens_ironwill:40}Other Facts and Random Stuff{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}So other stuff about me, let’s see…I have X-Ray vision! *laughs* nah not really, I’m just goofin’ with ya! Well ya know you can always say to me “Hey Slacker, what’s something I don’t know about ya?” and I’ll give you an answer for sure.\n\nOh, did I tell ya about my hero? I take it by the blank look on your face the answer is no, we all gotta have a hero ya know someone to look up to. Hey stop laughing! I aint that short that I look up at everyone, sheesh. Anyways, my hero is the mighty THRALL! Why? Cause he is frickin awesome, we Goblins helped him out long ago and he in return made us part of the Horde. I have a super rare Thrall action figure and not only that but I have a first edition near mint Thrall Hearthstone card I keep with me at ALL times! If you ask nicely you can see it, just make sure you washed those hands of yours!\n\nI always have ice cream or cakes on me, so if you want one just ask! I keep them in a magic bag *wiggles her fingers all mysteriously* well it’s not really magic, just good at keeping the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold. \n\nMy skills with engineering seem to be getting better, I like to mess around making (and breaking) things. So far none of my inventions have resulted in my death, so I gotta be doing something right! \n\nOh, last thing. I am a very friendly Goblin, honestly it is hard for me to hate anyone. Heck I even made friends with a Murloc once! I mean yea, I don’t like the Alliance but ya know that’s sorta a given thing with members of Horde I suppose. {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_garrison_cargoship:40}The Future{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What are my plans for the future? Well, once this stupid War is over, because it has to end at some point? I want continue my adventure with my animal companions by getting myself a boat. Not one of those huge fancy schmancy boats the Horde and Alliance use, but a small boat just big enough for me and my pals. Maybe…I could build one? I am good at building stuff when needed to! But anyways, yeah explore the seas maybe find myself my own Island…That’s the life for me, because there is nothing scary or dangerous out at sea, right? {/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:achievement_bg_grab_cap_flagunderxseconds:40}Post War Activities{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}What have I been up to since the war ended? Gee, what haven’t I been up to! Let’s see, at first, I got a job fixing up the damaged and broken mechs and over goblin inventions that got wrecked in the war. After that I had a tea party with Thrall, turns out he doesn’t like tea all that much…he sure does like a good cake though! And well, what have I been up to lately…you really wanna know? Come closer...closer…closer still…\n\nNONE OF YA GOD DAMN BUSINESS! \n\nI kid, I kid! I have spent a lot of time in Icecrown, why Icecrown ya ask? Am I looking to become the Lich Queen? No, don’t be stupid sheesh. I have been constructing Mechs, Gadgets, Gizmos and testing them there, because no one is really gonna moan if I blow up a chunk of a mountain in Icecrown. Yea, I am careful, I don’t blow stuff up near the Citadel. \n\nMy latest invention is pretty awesome if I do so say so myself, which I do…a lot! One of my Mechs had its arms fall off randomly one day, I think I didn’t tighten some of the bolts or something. Then it hit me, quick swapping of Mech parts! Can easily be done, so I developed a new system of connections and relays which allow for a Mech to have its arms quickly changed for Drills or Guns…or a Cake Gun! I call it the Lock and Load System. I have made quite a bit of money selling this system to Mech owners. See I am smart and only I know exactly how to fit it properly without it causing catastrophic failure.\n\nOh, the Boat? Yea I built it, haven’t had a chance to take it anywhere…haven’t even named it yet! I was thinking the Awesome Ship of Amazing Awesomeness! Whatcha mean that’s too long of a name! Fine I’ll think of a better name at some point…{/col}\n\n\n{col:184c86}{icon:inv_misc_paperbundle04b:40}Art{/col}\n\n{col:FFFFFF}This is where I would put my Art...If I had some! {/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-rogue-dreadblades:256:128}\n",

His vivid and sometimes almost skittish Grey-eyes displayed a sharp contrast with his placid face. A distinct feature of his being his mangled left ear, the cut was too uniform to be an accident, its twin however was intact. His build could easily be described as an inverted triangle, the width of his shoulders combined with his fit physique made his body look wiry. His array of clothing varied, however the constant factor was their tendency to allow for maximum use of his agility even thouh his style of choice made him appear to be among the Roguish type.\n\n\n{h3:c}Background{/h3}\n\nAnother fine Specimen among the 'quitters', he abandoned the dunes he hardly called home for better horizons. Embracing the life of a sailor allowed him to experience adventures... Not all good or bad but he found it better than Scavenging for survival. Thanks to that, he acquiered new skills, refined the old ones and taking on further challenges on his own now. Today he's a proud owner of his own Sailboat, Carmela's Spite.\n\n\n{h3:c}Of Interest{/h3}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff0e00}A Wanted poster is put across the major cities of the Alliance with a harbor.

His sense of humour is bad and he doesn't know what small talk means. His words or actions sometimes suggest that he is pure evil and sometimes the exact opposite.

On his left shoulder, rests a small wooden shield, honouring his membership in the Painted Shields. Short pads of leather, painted in gold wrapped around his arms. Under his tabard, a tunic made out of dinosaur's skin with a jaw of a shark attached to it.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_glove_mail_raidshaman_l_01:25}{/h1}\n{col:6cfdff}Two light gloves made out of Sethrak leather, pained in red somewhat protecting his hands and wrists, but most importantly, looking very fashionable. Pouches and bags on his belt that only the shadow hunter knows what's inside them. Hook attached to Dinokil's right side, helping him with carrying any special offerings.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ivn_pant_armor_zandalaritroll_d_01:25}{icon:inv_boots_mail_01:25}{/h1}\n{col:6cfdff}With his top body parts, mostly on right side good covered, Dinokil uses typical cloth pants and boots made from Sethrak leather, stylised in zandalari style to let him move and run freely.\n\n{h1:c}Weapons{/h1}\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_axe_2h_zandalarquest_b_01:25}{/h1}\n{col:6cfdff}Hexbreaker, legendary axe made for Warbringer Ar'khala out of gold and as it's hilt, stories tell that it is made out of Kimbul's fang itself! Decorated with carvings simbolizing Eraka No Kimbul. Enchanted by the priesthood, the axe completly intercepts any kinds of magic, other then the Loa based around it's wielder. Troll who holds the hexbreaker is unable to cast his voodoo, but can easly overcome other spellcasters, as the axe can easly block most magics and even cut pyroblast in half.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_bow_1h_zandalari_c_01:25}{icon:ability_hunter_chimerashot2:25}{/h1}\n{col:6cfdff}Traditional paku'ra bow, painted in red to better fit his overall presentation and a quilver full of wooden arrows with carved chants to Zanza on each one of them, allowing the shadow hunter to cast Arcane Shots from his bow.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}Loa blessings{/h1}\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_giantsnake_brown:25}{/h1}\n{col:ceff28}One of the \"evil\" Loa that Dinokil serves is Dambala, the Loa of treachery. Dambala bestows Dinokil the ability to change his shape into a cobra of different sizes. He could choose to either become a small adder that can slip through tight surfaces, or a cobra bigger than average raptor.\nAs powerful as this ability seems, the shadow hunter uses it -very- rarely, because the shapeshift brings incredible pain to his body, forcing his bones to break and bend his flesh to scales.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_kimibul:25}{/h1}\n{col:ff8900}Closest Loa to Dinokil is Eraka no Kimbul. His family have been serving the King of Cats for generations, even when the Loa had to protect his honor and didn't accept any new followers. Shadow Hunter can call upon his skills and hold fast reflexes and running speed, his limbs feeling lightweight and swift, while the mind has an aura of clear thought. Kimbul can also grant Dinokil the \"Predator's awareness\", allowing the shadow hunter to sense heat and -see- while he is temporarily blinded.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_kragwa:25}{/h1}\n{col:abff95}The huge protector lands Dinokil a portion of his powers, as he trusts the shadow hunter cares more about the others, than himself. Dinokil is not the greatest healer, he prefers to act and use his powers to protect others from getting hurt, not to heal their wounds, but that doesn't mean that he can't heal. Shadow hunter can channel the Huge One through his rush'kah mask and let Krag'wa work through him to save lifes. Krag'wa can also temporarily increase Dinokil's body weight by up to two hundred pounds. His body's apperance remaining the same (just glowing in eerie green), but allowing him for one hefty punch.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_bwonsomdi:25}{/h1}\n{col:a6a6a6}All though Dinokil never liked Bwonsamdi, for he is the Loa who took his closest friend from him, he respects the Loa of Kings and continues to send souls to him for his favour. Shadow hunter can channel Bwonsamdi through his rush'kah mask and use \"Smite undead\" ability. Evoking this spell allowes Dinokil to have a searing touch that can burn and blister the skin of an undead like a hand coated in fiery acid.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_akuna:25}{/h1}\n{col:69eeff}The thunder lizard can invoke himself through Dinokil's mask and channel his wrath in the from of lightning. This spell should not be used often, as it can hurt not only the target, but  the shadow hunter too. On top of that, once a month Dinokil can perform a ritual in which he can erase one's memory, but the target must agree to it, for the spell to work. It can't erase someone's memory fully, but can help forget about a certain hard thing, like death of a friend or lover.\n\n{h1:c}{icon:ability_hunter_pet_dragonhawk:25}{/h1}\n{col:ff7b66}It is thanks to the great dragonhawk, that Dinokil can become barly visable. When the shadow hunter is in need, he can invoke Jan'alai's boon and grant himself a turbulent stealth that cannot be seen or heard by enemies. On top of that, Dinokil is able to create a spark of fire between his fingers, fairly useless in fights, but he can use it to light a bonfire, set his arrow on fire or seal a nasty wound if he couldn't heal it.\n\n\n\n",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

A woman i loved and people i called friends. Then, a story as old as the desert itself unfolded. The Sethrak attacked us, wanted us as slaves. It didn´t take long and we were chained. I dont now how much time we´ve been there, but one day a Champion of the Horde and a girl called Nisha attacked the slave camp and gave us weapons to fight back. Many of us where still weakened from days without food and hours without water chained up in the desert sun. We did our best but couldn´t make it out wihtout losses. Rima, the one i loved, fell that day. I remember holding her...i couldn´t do anything while i saw the life leaving her eyes..\nAfter that i was alone. Just three of our Caravan had survided.

I helped him, dragged him into a cold cave and gave him some of the water from an oasis near by. After a couple of days he was healed and even thou i hessitated we travelled together. He was locking for something in our desert. We visited ruins and he gathered some strange artifacts. Some of them i heard whispering in a strange tounge, even today i dont know what they said,but only today i know that this was probably a good thing. He started to tell me some things about those artifacts, about how there are things in this world that can scatter the veil between life and death. Still haunted by Rimas lifeless eyes i listened. So we gethered more and more of those things and he taught me more and more secrets about powers that some would consider as witchcraft. The day came when we had gathered enough and only one thing was still missing for our rituals. Life. Only with life you can controll death, at least thats what he taught me. As ashamed as i am to say that, but we gathered life. I was blinded, maybe by the artifacts, maybe just by the possibility to see Rima again. So we captured some of my people...some Vulpera...i\nI couldn´t look into there eyes but i also couldn´t resist the whispers. \nThe ritual was ready and  i was eager to see my love again. We satrted the sacrefice...one after another i murdered them while m<y love was manifesting herself with everey soul i sacreficed. Then i heard her voice, but not as i remembered.

A horde, you could say....\nAs soon as the ships had make it to shore a battle began. I listened to the warcrys and watched the chaos unfulding befor me. \nIt didnt´t take long and a creature from the ships ran directly at me. Shouting something i cuoldn´t understand. I try to ran but my legs wherent the best anymore even back then. So it caught up to me and the only thing i remember was waking up in an camp while a green creature tendet to my wounds. It was an Orc and after i saw all the suffering arround me, all those who where wounded by the battle, i helped him. With that i had cause again and the Orc taugh me how to heal the wounded.

						["TX"] = "Physical Description\n\n{col:ffffff}With a near perfect symmetry to her facial features, which is common among the Blood Elves of Quel'Thalas, Relena can be described as an exceptionally beautiful. The fair features of elven beauty have been seemingly graced with the radiance of the sun, but also by her own maintenance.\n\nTo onlookers, she must be in the prime of her life, making it hard to discern her exact age. Her almond-shaped eyes, which at one point radiated with the arcane glow, now show an emerald hue of the fel. Obscuring her jade iris by a little. Her long eyelashes neatly decorating her orbs of observation.\n\nAbove her eyes rests a neatly trimmed pair of long and slender eyebrows. Which shows that she still gives proper attention to her looks. Their dye is the same crimson as her hair. Her nose is small and slender and moves delicately to a curve upward at the tip, common among the elves of the High Home, which only further compliments her facial beauty. Relena sports relatively high cheekbones, which gives an enticing detail to her visage, complimented nicely with her soft looking chin. Her lips are thin but rose colored. On special occasions she can be seen wearing a neat red lipstick on them.\n\nOverall, these features give Relena a warm and welcoming expression. Finishing off this look is her elegant long, hazel hair. It holds a silken soft feature and touch. Curling playfully around her head at some places. It shows that this elf is making sure to keep her hair in presentable state. Her hair is sumptuously thick and sports a few tresses to the flanks of her face, reaching down to well passed her neck.\n\nThough she is not overly tall for an elf, standing at an average height, she gives the appearance of being a lot longer thanks to her long and slender legs supporting her body. Relena’s figure is voluptuous, with ample amounts of flesh in all the most enticing places. Though, this is often not seen thanks to the layers of clothing she prefers to wear. Her muscles aren't anything special. Though she doesn't appear like a stick, it is easy to see that she refrains from performing heavy bodily exercise. Performing just the necessary to remain in a healthy condition.\n\nRelena sports a proper sized chest that supports her head delicately. Below lies the expanse of her stomach, relatively slender and quite feminine. A slim and round bellybutton decorates her healthy abdomen unmistaken feminine in appearance. Further down below, her firm waist flares into wide hips that doesn't appear to have ever carried any children in the past.\n\nOver the years of active service, her body had become subject to several injuries. Though not devoid of minor cuts, they are not as easily visible as her burn marks, which covers the expanse of her entire right side of her body. Though she does her best to hide this unsightly appearance, whatever she can't hide is easily spotted, especially around her face.{/col}",

She would have never imagined that an evil such as the scourge would exist on Azeroth. The fall saw her change in personality. She became more daring, no longer a passionate hunter; she felt guilty every time she shot a bird out of the sky. Feeling that this senseless killing was something that would lower her to the levels of the scourge.\n\nShe devotes her life now to serve the High Home. Once she enlisted into the military, she was taught proper combat techniques with the sword, shield, and spear. But further specialized training with the Light or magics would be obtained once she would join a military order. \n\nThanks to these trainings, she grew more confident and secure. But she still has a long way to go.{/col}\n",

The grand-daughter of Magisters, Relena was bookish and frail as a child. However, her physician father brought her up to be accustomed to the outdoors. Having learned to fish and hunt from her father, she was fond of venturing outdoors into the woods with Vranus Keenburst, her best friend.\nThe simple family lived in a well-kept mansion just outside Sun’s Reach, the harbor of Quel’Thalas. The household consisted of her father, mother and her butler Eridon. The latter of which she spent a lot of time with playing when she was just a toddler, whenever her mother was not homeschooling her and Vranus was off to school himself. Thanks to the teachings of her mother, Relena grew up to become a proper woman. \n\nAdulthood would find Relena having grown to exactly what her parents thought was best for her. Mature, polite and reserved, she attended every noble gathering with other lords and ladies. She enjoys the life of wealth, but even then, she never looked down on those who weren’t as wealthy as herself.\n\nAfter the fall of Quel’Thalas by the scourge, Relena wished to join the Blood Knights with Vranus, but could not enlist with her friend because of a heart murmur. The desire of joining the Knights was born during the battle of Quel’Thalas, when she and her family were hiding in the mansion’s basement while soldiers fought of the undead and used the mansion as stronghold for a few days. \nHearing the endless cries of pain and suffering above. Relena was already hundreds of years old, and the life of complacency had made her unable to fight and aid those in need. Her family survived the scourge, and slowly but surely, life was rebuilt, the mansion restored and ordered preserved.\n\nBut for Relena, her life had changed. Gone were most of her friends she had made prior to the fall, and the constant reminder of her being unable to help out in battle, gnawed at the back of her mind. During the cataclysm, her best friend Vranus joined the Blood Knights. Once more Relena tried to enlist but the heart murmur kept her from joining the Knights. It wouldn’t be until some time later, that she eventually was allowed. Her first education was done in combat with the sword, before she would orientate herself to a specialized field. For her the choice was easy; Blood Knight{/col}.\n",

It doesn't appear extremely well-kept, but is by no means ugly or unkempt. Moving down her face, you see her wide brown eyes, usually gazing about in a somewhat lazy manner, yet she seems aware of her surroundings to some extent. Her nose is straight and fine, nothing of note about it, except the ring pierced into it. Her mouth sits below her nose, not much of note to be seen there either. She has the standard orc tusks protruding from her lower jaw, causing her to jut slightly. On the sides of her head are her ears. Pointy and with two rings pierced each. Her chin is strong, as is to be expected from orcs.\n \nMoving on from her face, we come to her body. She has broad shoulders, leading down to her arms, which are quite thick and muscular, although not overly so when compared to other members of her race. Still, her biceps and triceps bulge out on her upper arms. Her hands are fairly standard, and free of scarring.\nWhat might catch one's eye is her quite large chest. A pair of rather huge breasts extended from her torso, being quite noticable indeed. Beyond her chest is her stomach. Flat, and with the faint outline of a sixpack apparent. Her back is also fairly muscular, outlines of muscles visible down the length of it.\n \nMoving on to her lower body. She has wide hips, and a fairly large, yet firm bum, wiggling lightly as she strides. Her legs are also quite strong, as with the rest of her body, big thighs and muscular calves. Her feet are nothing extraordinary, they get her where she needs to go.\n \nHer lips have a tendency to curl into a crooked smirk or grin as she talks to people. Perhaps she's easily amused, or perhaps she hides a devious mind.{/h3}\n\n\n\n\n\n",

True, like many elves he bears the same conventionally pleasant features; Sharp, chiseled as if wrought from a pristine block of marble and set in an injay framed by his raven black hair. By elven standards though?.. He was nothing special. Sure, pleasant enough on the eyes from a facial perspective with his face framed by a long flowing mane of jack black hair that billows down to the base of his back though he was nothing that would turn every gaze in a crowded room. It does help his case though that at least he’s usually dressed in a smile. Thin, pale lips sitting above a thick goatee tied off by a simple green band. \n\nOdd is a word that can be applied to his clothing as well. His clothing, whilst at a distance looks as though he has a very good relationship with his tailor. From his trimmed tunics and well fitting britches to his leather boots and jeweled bracers he could be forgiven when seen from afar as a well to do elf who spends a good amount of coin on his clothing and appearance… This all falls apart though once you get close enough for a better look. This elf’s clothing could once have been said to be well tailored and likely expensive attire. Unfortunately little remained by this point of the original garment. Stitching was different colours across each seam, patches of fabric were just slightly off colour from one section of a tunic to the next and what looked like a floral pattern stitched into his trousers turned out to just be an ever expanding collection of repair jobs and patching. He was presentable, though it’s clear he doesn’t spend as much on his cosmetic appearance than most. \n",

At least it seems here is where he takes the extra effort, possessing a well trained and refined form not dissimilar from any other soldier.. Not a frail bookworm this one. \n\nIf seen during combat Vaelath’s equipment for battle is about as practical as he can manage in the sky. His armour’s painted the green and gold of his unit, fresh ringmail laid over a padded shirt that extends as far as his bracers that tuck neatly under his reinforced gauntlets. It extends down his legs as well, though the extra leg protection strapped to his thighs and knees is often hidden by other parts of his equipment. His outer layer is an open battle robe that is tucked neatly around his tabard and armour, with the only the lower sections of the well tailored coat allowed to drop freely around his legs. And to finish it all off? A set of riveted steel pauldrons that straddle his shoulders, designed to deflect incoming blades and missiles fated to find and ruin the elf’s charming visage. He wears a cloak of course depending on the circumstances, though not much is to be said about the pine green fur lined garment. It’s cheap, disposable and does the job when he needs it. \n",

					["TX"] = "{link*https://i.imgur.com/5IxYeu3.jpg*Art commission}\n\nBrief Description: \n\nVelindria is a prime example of Elven features, with her body being rather feminine and elegant in nature, though still kept to a high standard of health with a noticeable toning of muscles to it. She quite clearly cares for her appearance, occasionally wearing nail polish or paint and very often has her raven-black hair in a long braid. Her equipment and attires are always colour coordinated and unmistakably Elven in their style.\nA few piercings are spotted on her body, some in her ears and one in her navel, a gold ring with an azure blue gem in it.\n\nExtended Description:\n\nVelindria is a taller than average Sin'dorei with long and raven-black hair, often put into a lengthy braid hanging from the back of her head, usually slung over her shoulder and cascading down her front. Most of the time she has a neutral or curious expression on her features.\n\nThe womans face is very typically Elven, with soft edges, smooth and rounded cheeks and chin. Her nose extending out into a small yet elegant point, and her eyes being slanted slightly in the usual fashion. Her lips usually carrying a light layer of lipstick in a red colour.\n\nHer hair is surprisingly smooth and silky to touch, a lot of attention seeming to be put into it. It spends most of its time braided, but at times one might find her with it let loose, letting it fall on her shoulders and down her back, roughly reaching the middle of it.\n\nShe carries the natural shape of her kin, with a healthy hourglass figure adorning her body. This being showcased by her usually avoiding too loose clothes, preferring somewhat tighter tops or outfits.\n\nSomething that is rather obvious, especially in her most common attire, is that she likes to keep fit and stay in shape. Her stomach showing some subtle abs, only visible if one were to take a closer look. Her nails extend slightly past her fingertips, ending in a smooth curve at the tips of them.\n\nHer typical outfit consists of a long skirt, reaching down to just above her ankles. It being made out of thin and soft wool, almost feeling close to silk, though any knowledge about either fabric would make it more obvious. The upper portion being clothed by a strapless top in matching blue and yellow colours, made out of the same materials.\n\nIn comparison to her torso, she has rather long and sleek legs that seem regularly trained, something that may strike most as odd considering Velindria's appearance. Her toenails tending to have some kind of nail polish or nail paint on them, often in a blue colour.\n\nThe females arms are about average in size and not quite as toned as her legs are, though still slim and healthy with the expected feminine hands and fingers being found at the end of them, sometimes also with blue nail paint adorning them.\n\nAdorning her narrowly pointed ears are two golden rings, placed a bit above halfway up the length of the ears. The left ear carrying two earrings, with the right only having a single closer to the tip.\n\nLocated in her belly button is yet another piercing, one that often shows in her usual attires. It is also a golden ring, but at the apex of it, it has an azure blue gem embedded in it, one that matches the colour of her most common attire. It's not large, but big enough to notice it from a distance, as well.\n\nVelindria has nothing in the way of scars on her body, not somebody that seems to have experienced lots of strife or combat in her life, which is rather odd considering her age. It is suspiciously pristine.\n\nShe has the look of a woman well into adulthood, but her body has no wrinkles or noticeable signs of old age on it, having resisted the test of time surprisingly well, something she seems to take pride in.\n\nLocated around her waist, attached to her belt, are various sacks and satchels of alternating sizes. To anyone sensitive enough to magic, they might feel a noticeable degree of energies around the woman, though exactly where from is hard to discern. The containers being a prime location, however.\n\nVelindria also has a secondary attire, which merely consists of a very simple looking black leather and cloth outfit, a few decorations spotted here and there on it, if not only to make it look a bit more elven in origin, otherwise looking completely plain, perhaps too plain for an elf like her. It would often have a black woolen cloak, with some decoration around the edges of it, with it. It's used to shield her from the harsh elements, probably a travelling attire of hers.\n\nA hat in matching theme is often worn with this set, being used to give shadow for her eyes in bright and sunlit areas. The craftmanship of said headwear is surprisingly good, the materials used for it clearly of a very high quality.\n\nAlong with the rest of her supplies and equipment, she carries a long scabbard on her belt, connected on the left side of it. Depending on her attire, this is either a blue and gold leather sheath, or a black and gold one, both of similar design and clearly elven.\n\nOften held in her hand or hanging from her back through a simple system that locks it in place, is a staff. The item being constructed from a long metal rod with a large and bright yellow crystal spotted at the tip of it, and four smaller ones of similar design circling the main one.\n\nA larger container of sorts placed on the right side of her belt, also in matching colours to the current colour theme of what she's wearing at the moment. It has a very similar shape to that of a tome, Velindria's spellbook held inside. The book itself being matched to her outfit as well, and with golden ornaments in a very elven style across the surface and spine of it.\n\nA much rarer sight, especially when not residing on or near a battlefield, is a third attire, which happens to be much more combat oriented. It consists of some sort of metal tiara, with a sizeable purple gem embedded on the front of it, it obviously being enchanted. Two spikes protrude from the headwear in both the back and above the crystal, the ones in the rear much larger.\n\nA pair of thick leather shoulderguards, reinforced with bits of metal and a decorative array of luminescent feathers sticking out from below them, giving off a soft magical sensation when near the mage. Yet another gem of similar colour spotted on either shoulder, these most likely providing energy to the plumes. Attached to the shoulderpads is a long cloak, the colours specifically chosen to suit the outfit.\n\nCovering her form is a long robe, also made of durable leathers, dyed to suit the colour scheme. No energy having been spared on making the attire look as decorative and impressive as possible to onlookers. A pair of cloth gloves with bits of leather and thin strips of metal protecting her hands underneath the sleeves of her dress, as well as a pair of sturdy travelling boots.\n\nSpotted in a scabbard hanging from her waist is an unmistakably Elven blade, the pommel of it painted black. A faint, purple glow covering the sword, giving off a soft hum if listening closely. On her other side hangs a strange disklike object, many crystals sticking out from bits of metal. She seems to use it as an improvised buckler.",

This state is the one she dislikes and hates the most considering she turns into a near litearl dumb dog.. Driven by mostly insict.. unable to speak much words and quite dumb.. In this state she mostly just tries to get up to people and demand affection by barking or just.. sitting there.. as if her brain had melted and the only thing that remained was 5% of her elf self and 5% of her canine self\n\nThings she likes in this form: Being patted, being called a good girl, getting any sort of physical affection, not talking, barking, drooling, being hugged, rubbing up to peopl and getting treats.\n\n\n\n\n\n{/col}{/h3}\n\n",

She is calm and reserved and aims to speak respectful to those around her. Though somtimes stubborn in some aspects, it shows that she doesn't simply let herself walked over by others.\n\nThis makes it pleasant for many people to be around her. She puts others before her and acts out of kindness to help others. It is not easy to anger this elf, but should push come to shove, she doesn't shy away to show her fangs. \n\nAlenore is a sweetooth and can easily be swayed with sweets and candy, much to her own dismay as she is worried she might get fat from too much consumptions. Overall, however, Alenore radiates positivity towards others. {/col}\n\n{icon:INV_Misc_Book_01:25} {col:99ff69}- Background{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Alenore was born in the prestigious family of high-elven rangers who made their home within Windrunner Village, shadowd by the impressive Windrunner spire, in the western parts of what is now called the Ghostlands. She is the second-born daughter of Turonal and Sele'mari Winterfall, and as such, the younger sister of Aru'naere.\n\nDispite archery being the legacy of her family, Alenore didn't have much interest in the profession and aspired to become a magister in the High Home. Showing affiliation with both the arcane as well as pyromancy, she was eventually send to the capital city to undergo professional training from the magisters.\n\nThough her sister never liked the fact that her younger sibling didn't become a farstrider like she did, the two were still very close and spent most of their times together outside their studies and training. Alenore has always looked up to her sister and aspired to become a strong individual as her someday. This would change, however, when Quel'Thalas fell to the Scourge. Her family was routed like many others, including her sister.\n\nThe heartbreaking news that her sister had become a Dark Ranger in service of Lady Windrunner was a dark time for Alenore. Dispite this, she had joined with the Horde and fought alongside her new allies for several years.\n\nShe recently decided to give up on being a mage and started her studies with archery. Coming from a prestigeous household known for their archery skills, she found that if she wished to restore her house, she had to continue their legacy. {/col}\n\n{icon:Achievement_Character_Bloodelf_Female:25} {col:99ff69}- Appearance{/col}\n{col:ffffff}With a new perfect symmetry to her facial features, which was common among the Elves of Quel'Thalas, Alenore can be described as an exceptionally beautiful individual.\n\nTo onlookers, she must be in the prime of her life, making it hard to discern her exact age. Her almond-shaped eyes, are rich in color with a distinct sea-cyan. Obsucring her marine iris by a little. Her long eyelashes neatly decorating her orbs of observation.\n\nAbove her eyes rests a neatly trimmed pair of long and slender eyebrows. Which shows that she still gives proper attention to her looks. Their dye is the same blonde as her sun-kissed hair. Her nose is small and slender and moves delicately to a curve upward at the tip, common among the elves of the High Home, which only further compliments her facial beauty. Alenore sports relatively high cheekbones, which gives an enticing detail to her visage, complimented nicely with her soft looking chin. Her lips are thin and don't appear to be wearing any lipstick at all times, still, they are colored with life and radiate a small pinkish hue from her otherwise pale skintone.\n\nOverall, these features give Alenore a warm and welcoming expression. Finishing off this look is her elegant long, blonde hair, curling playfully around her head at some places. It shows that this elf is making sure to keep her hair in presentable state. Her hair is sumptiously thick and sports a few tresses to the flanks of her face, reaching down to well passed her neck.\n\nThough she is not overly tall for an elf, standing at an average height, she gives the appearance of being a lot longer thanks to her long and sleder legs supporting her body. Though, this is often not seen thanks to the layers of clothing she prefers to wear. Her muscles aren't anything special. Though she doesn't appear like a stick, it is easy to see that she refrains from performing heavy bodily exercise. Perfoming just the neccesary to remain in a healthy condition.\n\nBelow her chest lies the expanse of her stomach, relatively slender and quite feminine. A slim and round bellybutton decorates her healthy abdomen unimstakingly feminine in appearance. Further down below, her firm waist flares into wide hips that doesn't appear to have ever carried any children in the past. All in all, it gives this elf an almost hourglass shaped figure.  {/col}\n\n{icon:Ability_Warrior_WeaponMastery:25} {col:99ff69}- Weapons{/col}\n{col:ffffff}When it comes to weapons, Alenore doesn't have many of them. She carries a long and slender bow with her of standard elven design.\n\nHaving been a mage prior to being a ranger, she is well-versed in the use of arcane and fire magic. Though she only uses magic in combat if the situation demands it. {/col}\n\n{icon:inv_misc_stormlordsfavor:25} {col:99ff69}- IC Bits{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Voice reference: Not yet determined{/col}\n\n{icon:Achievement_LegionPvP5Tier3:25} {col:99ff69}- OOC Bits{/col}\n{col:ffffff}± 10 Years of RP Experience.\nAlways approachable\nCan do /roll battle but prefer emotes.\nKind, knowledgeable about most lore, helpful, chance-giving, respectful, tolerating, direct. \nProfile created: 25/07/19{/col}",

However, though his outward manner is jovial all-around, he is still built for speed and further clues all about his person suggest he isn't helpless nor as absent-minded as he lets on. Taztai's attire is light and loose with a preference for warm colours, allowing for ease of movement and his hands and feet, callussed in certain places from repeat impact, point to his focus on hand-to-hand combat./col}",

Their parents fanatically worshipped a Nathrezim, who in the tome Izzy still carries, was named Izzarin, which led to Izzy gaining their full name.  At a young age, Izzari was trained in the ways of the dark arts by their parents, this would lead to them being used as a conduit for demonic energy by the two, which led to their want to leave their family behind. They finally did this when they were seventeen, they stole many things from their parents' collection to help keep themself safe, including a fel codex and a skull possessed by a demonic being.\n\nAs they wandered around, they visited both Horde and Alliance settlements, learning many things from both, things like more magic and languages. A run-in with a \"strong opinioned\" Alliance soldier made them lean more heavily towards the Horde and eventually joining them fully.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WarlockDemonology:256:128}\n\n{p:c}Appearance : Izzy on the surface seems to be quite a typical goblin, if not slightly more attractive. They have a toned frame and slender face, though some more demonic features stay shown, like fangs and sharp claws. Beneath their magical facade, Izzy appears much more demonic, small horns and fel cracked skin now show.\n\n\nPersonality : Izzy at first glance seems like one of the snarkiest, fun-loving and most daring goblins there is, but trust me, they can get deadly serious...emphasis on the \"deadly\" part, if you get on their bad side.{/p}\n",

					["TX"] = "Strolling down the street, a fifteen-year-old girl. With her long dark hair, covered in mud and filth, with green eyes. Deep green eyes, emerald green eyes. A girl named Maxim'elora Strongvein. Abandoned and left alone, she looks back to the point where she is now. Her life was anything but roses.\n\nIt started with her mother, Daendori Oddfeast. She hooked a royal guard. They saw each other regularly and this suited the two. The more they saw each other, the more contact there was. She eventually got pregnant by Tynvendon Strongvein, a royal guard from the Spire, of Silvermoon City. Before she could tell she is pregnant, he broke off contact with her. He was not allowed and did not want contact with a normal citizen. It was hard, very heavy. She had a child in her stomach, with no future. No plan for the future and she knew she had to do it alone but how? Her own family fought in the war or were killed or died of old age. Daendori stood defeated by the fountain, watching the man she was so deeply in love with walked away. To his group, to his team and every step further away from her.\n\nThe nine months pass quickly but whether Daendori can enjoy this is not so sure. She mainly blames the others. She can no longer do what she likes to do and that is gardening. Her beautiful garden at the house is overgrown, weathered, you can consider it lost. She couldn't help it anymore, if she couldn't bend over, move freely or spend hours. The unborn child got in her way, she couldn't do it anymore. Tynvendon was not even in the picture anymore. In nine months he is married to a woman, royal magister of the Spire. This news finally reached her. She felt nothing more than anger and horror, not only towards him. But also to the unborn child. After the moon was at its highest position, the contractions were induced. Her neighbors heard and called a doctor. This accompanied her with the birth of Max, which lasted a few hours in the end. For a first child, it was quite easy and before she knew it, Max was in her arms. Cleaned and cut loose from her umbilical cord and wrapped in a blanket, Max looked at her mother. She was silent after crying for a long time, calm with her green emerald eyes. Daendori didn't know what to feel. Joy of a birth, of a child. Hate by betrayal or what it's never meant to be. He is a royal guard and she is a citizen, a simple resident of Silvermoon. She was just a gardener, a cook.\n\nLittle Maxim’elora’s childhood was filled with conflict almost from the very start. Daendori, Maxim’s mother, but a mere 4 months into her pregnancy was abandoned by the one she loved, Maxim’s father… Tyvendon. Daendori, however, never blamed the child for the father walking out on her before receiving the news. Many months pass by and Max is brought into this world and upon one beautiful summer day in Silvermoon City, Daendori strolled along the streets, with baby Maxim’elora in a tiny baby carrier, tied to her chest.The little elf enjoyed Silvermoon, each floating green fel-crystal gleaming amongst the sunlight in the sky and the gentle hum of the city… it was calming. Much like all the other Sin’dorei, Maxim was given arcane to supplement her needs, as was the Sin’dorei curse. Though it saved the\nelves, Daendori disliked the power that addiction to mana and fel brought and poor baby Maxim was too adolescent to understand. The mother always told her daughter that Arcane can be just as bad as anything else, it could cause hatred and destruction. Maxim’s mother rounds a corner to spot a rather familiar face, Daendori’s former lover Tyvendon. Anger filled her, but it wasn’t something to spark a rage, no, it was a deep sadness that her little girl was unaware of. Many thoughts rushed through the Mother’s mind, “Should I tell him?”, “Is it better for him not to know?”. Daendori steeled her resolve, calmed\nher worry and took a breath as a stroke of courage filtered in. She patted herself down and raised her head high and proud and walks by, not even acknowledging the presence of the former lover.\n\nTime goes by and four years has passed, Maxim’elora was a fast learner. She managed to pick up walking and talking at a young age. The devious little girl had even learned to pick things up which drove her poor mother insane. Though the inquisitive little girl was confined to the house she lived in, no freedom, no exploration, it all became a bore after a while…\nHer mother, being protective, didn't allow her to try anything and the only people she spoke to was the odd visitor… every few weeks.\nThis wasn’t wholly Daendori’s fault however… She used to be a strong woman, one that worked as a gardener and supplied coin -AND- cooked for the family. But sadly Maxim’s mother fell into a depressive state after hearing that her family was practically cut in half in the war. Brothers, Sisters, Uncles and Aunts who all sacrificed their life to save azeroth from the threat at hand. This turns her bitter, almost a shell of her former self. She was growing\ndistant from her own daughter, perhaps the only one she had left. She simply didn’t understand Maxim either, why does she want to learn and not play? Raising a child was definitely more difficult than one had thought.\n\nTwo years passed and conflict remained in the house, at Maxim’s six birthday she received no cake, no celebration and not even the tiniest inkling of a gift. But oddly enough the girl was used to it by now. The living conditions for the pair were borderline squalid due to the Mother losing everything. The House, The luxurious garden. They had to move to a small room in the middle part of Silvermoon. The deprived area of the Elven city. And poor little Max was left with a rag doll, a gift that she had received from a sibling, and the clothes on\nher back. Which was the only thing she wore. Daendori, her condition getting worse over the years, cannot even fathom the idea of going outside the house and sends her daughter, Maxim’elora, to do her bidding… more and more each month. Maxim’elora gets to know a few people on the street, including slightly older children. They also wear dirty clothes, just like Maxim'elora. At first she was very shy, keeping her distance because she doesn't know how to communicate with others. An older girl notices this and takes her distance from Maxim'elora. For weeks the girl observes Maxim'elora and when she walks home, the girl addresses her. When she walks along, she tells who is where she lives and that she also cannot go to school. Maxim’elora gets to know her as Belnore Swiftrest. Belnore was only twelve years old and she too was the girl on the street. It takes a few months for Maxim'elora to dare to talk to her at all, and when she does, they are long stories. She finally comes out of her shell.\n\nYears go by until Maximelela has turned twelve years old. Not much has changed, other than herself. She's grown up, too mature for her age, but doesn't understand much about what she should be of her own age. She can take reasonable care of herself, such as taking care of food. She barely sees her mother, if at all. Maxim'elora was afraid of her. She didn't get answers to her questions, she had to do more and more around the house. Maxim’elora ran the entire household on her own, but learning became impossible. Maxim'elora still cannot read or write. What she used to feel for her mother is completely gone. No love, no affection. Only anger, hate and fear. Daendori was only concerned with herself. Man after man came by. Left Maximelora as filth, as if she didn't exist. A child who just enters your house, does your household and leaves again. She was deeply unhappy with her mother. One evening, Maxim'elora wanted to know who her father is so she could live there. Daendori was not served by this. She didn't answer, but she spanked Maxim'elora. Hit her hard until Maxim'elora found a way to flee the house. She didn't get it, how wrong she was. She does everything for her mother but nothing comes back, only hard words. Hate words, displeasure, anger. It wasn't Maximelela's fault that her father never wanted to contact her mother again. It was not her fault that her mother got pregnant. From then on, things only got worse. Dreandori takes the most impossible step a mother should never make. That day she walks the market looking for the wrong people. People you would rather not come near. Eventually she comes across a group, tells her that she has a worthless daughter and asks only twenty gold coins to take her over. The group agrees and Draendori runs home quickly, Maxim'elora says. She does not know what will happen to her, but she follows her mother, without any problems. Draendori arrives at the group and she pushes Maxim'elora towards the group. She looks around anxiously and the men start to judge her. Squeezing her arm, pricking her upper leg and pulling her hair for a reaction. Maxim'elora does not react strongly to it, just the opposite. She allowed it. She looked at her mother, filled in her eyes with disappointment, anger, fear, but especially hatred. How could her own mother do this to her. The group gives Draendori the money and Maxim'elora watches with her eyes wide open. They just gave money to her mother. Her mother suddenly sold her to total strangers. She couldn't believe it. Overwhelmed by her feelings, she runs to her mother, but just before she could grab her mother she was caught by the men. They held her no matter how loud she screamed for her mother, who slowly walks away. Proud that she can now buy some food and drinks. Without looking or blushing, Draendori walks on, the last moment Maxim'elora saw her mother. For weeks to months, she does not hear from her mother and has not seen her. Max, on the other hand, is starting to feel insecure. The group she was left with is a group of criminals. They force her to steal or be pathetic so that they can do their job.\n\nOne evening they go out again. They are going to try to rob a group of guards of their money. A few men take a knife and they approach Max. Max looks at them scared and she is being held. One of the leaders presses a knife against Max's cheek and slowly puts more pressure on her skin until a cut is made. No matter how hard Max thwarts, he keeps going until it's a reasonable wound. Max manages to gather courage and she kicks the man in his case. He gets furious because what man likes that. He looks at Max in silence and his eye color changes to black. The group around them are starting to get nervous. The leader approaches Max and places his hand on her head. He starts speaking a very old language, which is similar to void calling. Slowly Max starts to get a bad headache. She feels a lot of pain in her body, she is very uncomfortable. The man places his other hand on her stomach and sends a Shadow Orb in her stomach. All Max can remember is that she got a bad stomach ache and a huge headache. She wakes up again after a few days. She felt different. Completely different. She was no longer herself and there is a constant whisper in her head. Max slowly gets up and looks around her. Where was she? What happened? Why does she feel different? Where is everyone? When she starts walking, she sees that she is in the camp of the group, but no one is present at that her chance and she ran away. Very hard. She knows she is deep in the forest of Eversong Woods. She accepts no doubts and she keeps running. The whisper in her head forces her to stop and she can't think clearly when she runs towards Silvermoon. Before she's just over the hill, she is tackled by one of the gang members. Max screams for fear, pain, but most of all anger. She tries to break free but this fails. She is taken back to camp. The leader was not happy that she had run away. He paces along the campfire. What to do with her. He thought about it for a long time and snaps his fingers and she is grabbed by two men. The leader picks up his whip and they force her to her knees. “You are nothing but problems and that includes a punishment. You belong to me and you listen to me. And not only that. You do what I want without struggling. ” Max looks at him scared and she takes a deep breath. He lashes out over her back, legs, arms and shoulders. He wanted to enforce his leadership with this. After the punishment they release her. She starts to cry when she feels how much it hurts. She had no choice but to listen. She is then dragged to her tent, left as if she were nothing.\n\nShe follows the leader for months, does what is expected of her. For months she was often slapped in the face, punished. Max had to do something to get free, get away from the group. She goes and is allowed to go to Silvermoon more often and she does. She is fifteen years old and she walks down the street ……\n",

A large \"teardrop\" shaped necklace of black opal gemstone set in dazzling platinum rests around his neck and atop his collarbones, a piece of jewellery that matches a heart shaped black opal ring set in platinum claws that don's his left index finger. Both pieces of jewllery are very dear and treasured gifts it seems and ones that he is -very- reluctant to ever remove. In addition, a beatifully intricate golden frog ring adorns his right ring finger, one encrusted with beautiful emeralds for the eyes. \n\nMaestral's ears don a respectable amount of golden piercings, large hoops, smaller loops and star shaped studs being the most notable of which. To finish his look off, his nails are grown out to around 3 inches in length and finely manicured into a slender square-tipped shape, laquered in burgundy polish to compliment his facial makeup.\n\nThere also appears to be a new addition on his left hand...a wedding band most stunning!

Their demonic mutations and unique forms must be catered for accordingly after all, inspiration for such being taken from the very personal struggles in his married life.\n\nA perfectionist, a hopeless romantic at heart with an air of snobbery and dramatics, to say his personality marries well with his new profession would be no understatement. \n\nHe is as flamboyant as the garments he crafts...and one could unironically say he wears his personality on his sleeve...\n\n{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-55:64:64}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{h3:c}{col:ab0b28}\"When word spreads like wildfire that you kill for pay,\nthe association never truly leaves you.\nTry as I might to live a quiet and peaceful life...\n...This world will always want blood but rarely is it willing to dirty it's own hands.\n\"The Sanguine Harlequin\" never truly hangs up his daggers for good.\"\n{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{p:c}{col:c72f33}Whispers in the dark underworld tell tales of a brazen assassin. \n\nA painted man known only as \"The Sanguine Harlequin\". \n\nKilling to him is an exact art. One which must be executed with precision and artistic integrity. He believes death to be a thing of beauty and that if a life is to be forcefully taken, it must be done so with the utmost respect for the target in question's dignity, granting a clean and graceful end to their lives...\n\n\"The Sanguine Harlequin\" is by no means an assassin to get into contact with if a client is looking for a simple, cheap and brutal murder, but he has gained renown amongst those able to spare the coin for a more...\"theatrical\" and symbolic approach to death.\n\nHis calling card once a target is extinguished?\nA garnet heart-shaped gemstone held between the target's front teeth...{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-29:64:64}\n\n{h3:c}{col:cca040}Background:{/h3}{/col}\n{p:c}{col:c72f33}Not much is publically known of Lavarro's past besides the fact he was once one of the Darkmoon Faire's best crowdpleasing performers. \n\nWhat he only openly confesses as being a non-descript \"incident\" lead him to leave the faireground and start a life as a travelling performer and artist. He has travelled many cities to perform, Alliance and Horde occupied territories alike and has earned a modest living from such. \n\nAs he would say to anyone wishing to pursue the performing arts as a life career though, such a lifestyle must be subsided with another job on the sidelines to bring in a comfortable amount of money to live. In Lavarro's case, he chose assassination, an occupation he learned from an undisclosed source during quiet lulls in his performance schedules and to further make his training more lucrative, he has invested his talents for purely selfish and monetary gain. Or so he would have people believe. \n\nIt seems that Lavarro is not one to willingly open up about his past, prefering to hide behind his stage persona and have the world believe he is nothing more than a \"larger-than-life performer\". In due time, with trust, confidence and good reason, Lavarro may one day find it within himself to reveal more of the truth behind his past to someone beyond his close-knit family ties...{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:c72f33}Combat Capabilities:{/h3}{/col}\n{p:c}{col:cca040}As an assassin, and an exacting one at that, Lavarro prides himself in his ability to conceal himself out of sight and out of mind until his presense is needed, slinking off into the shadows until that time arises.\n\nPassionate about procuring rare and exotic poisons from around the world, he uses them, alongside his expertise with dagger combat and humanoid anatomy to kill with  precision, speed and with graceful flair and theatrical wonder, often using his own talents in contortion, poetry and acting to add a element of entertainment to his target's final moments.\n{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:cca040}Misc Facts:{/h3}{/col}\n{p:c}{col:c72f33}Lavarro has -many- years ago had a singular romance novel published that has since faded into the realms of obscurity, \"The Eve of Eversong Nights\" released under the psuedonym \"L.R.Darthorne\".\n\nHe has been known in the past to indulge  in magical \"cosmetic surgery\" to perfect his exterior appearance (His teeth being the most notably perfect feature. It is not an illusion, but a permanent physical change induced by magic). In recent months, he has reverted to a more \"natural\" representation of himself, removing some of the arcane incantations that once obscured his true visage.\n\nHe is vegetarian though not for any ethical or spiritual means, rather to preserve his fit and flexible physique. He -will- eat meat on rare occasions.\n\nAs an extension of his passion for collecting deadly poisons, Lavarro also keeps a small variety of poisonous Dart Frogs as pets and to harvest their toxins for use on his weapons. He thoroughly enjoys the theraputic side of keeping their terrariums well planted and natural looking, a tiny garden within his tiny travelling abode as it were, and even gives each frog it's own name. (Usually some rendition of \"Grenouille\"...meaning \"frog\" in Shalassian...)\n\nLavarro is multilingual in several languages, taking it upon himself to learn enough to translate most of his verbal shows into languages comprehensible to the audiences and places he travels to. He is by no means -fluent- in most of these languages but is knowledgable enough in them to get by. Notably, he is able to speak; Thalassian (Native tongue), Common, Orcish, Shalassian, Darnassian, Zandali and is currently learning Pandaren. \n{/col}{/p}\n",

Her love for hammers paid off when, on occasion, their caravan was assaulted by Sethrak Faithless seeking to enslave them. She fought them off valiantly with her smithy hammer and decided that now was the time to expand her knowledge on fighting, so she crafted herself a mighty hammer and armour to better defend herself and her caravan. \n\nWhen the caravan stationed at a camp, she would seek out the leading militia defending the camp and requested combat training, fixing their equipment in trade.\n\nShe trained day and night, learning to embrace her inner rage and channel it through her mighty hammer to crush those that would dare strike her family and their wandering caravan.\n\nHowever, no matter how much she trained, she was ill prepared for what was to come.\n\nThe might of the Faithless was growing day by day and the raiding parties were growing larger in number, one night while Stellira and her family were sleeping, a large Sethrak raiding party descended on their camp.\nShe quickly grabbed her trusty hammer she had crafted and rushed into the fray to defend herself and her family, but all was in vain, though she had managed to force the Faithless to retreat, her family was killed and her caravan was in ruin, burning hot and bright into the night sky.\n\nStellira was lost, she knew not what to do with herself, she stared into the starry night sky for hours, then she remembered tales at the campfire a few moons ago, tales of a group of travelling Vulpera who sought to explore the world and beyond, this idea rung true with her as she too wished to adventure and put her training to the test, she gathered up her equipment, any that had not been caught in the fires, and put it all in her bag and made ready for a long journey ahead.\n\nShe called out to her faithful Hyena companion \"Cheeky, come on girl, we're going to see the world\". Rustling could be heard from a nearby bush and out popped a large Hyena, still fightened from the events that happened a few hours ago.\n\nStellira scavenged the ruins of her camp and found a saddle and canopy which she fastened to Cheeky, climbed into the saddle and set off into the night.\n\nAfter travelling from night, through day and to dusk, she set up a small camp in an old Troll city, left to ruin. She was sleeping soundly when suddenly she was woken by heavy footsteps and voices, she quickly jumped up, grabbed her bag, and her trusty hammer, called for Cheeky to hide, and she too crept off to find somewhere to hide. The sounds of footsteps continued to get closer and she could see the light of a torch showing flickering shadows of the Faithless that were tracking her, she noticed a nearby tomb and quickly rushed inside, in the centre of this tomb was a half opened sarcophagus. She did not have time to think about the rights and wrong of desecrating the remains of the dead, her life was at stake, so she jumped inside and quietly pulled the lid over her, as she did she felt a sudden crunch between her footpaws.\n\nShe huddled within this sarcophagus for what felt like an eternity, until finally the footsteps and the voices faded into the distance.\n\nAfter waiting just a little while longer, she slid the sarcophagus back open, climbed out and returned to her camp, there were Sethrak tracks everywhere around her camp, she felt very fortunate indeed to have woken up just in time and glad that she travelled light for there was nothing in her possession for them to steal that was not in her bag.\n\nStellira set up camp again, hoping the Faithless would not return. As she began to tuck herself in, ready for sleep, a shadowy figure appeared before her, it did not speak, it did not act, it just stood there and stared at her with menacing eyes. Stellira did not sleep that night, for fear of what this being might do.\n\nThe following day, this weary eyed Vixen travelled once more, this time seeking shelter with the Horde, she was welcomed for her skills with both hammer and metal and made her way to a nearby inn in Orgrimmar.\n\nThat night, as tired as she was, she still could not sleep, the memories of that night in the dunes where her caravan was destroyed haunted her, she sat on her bed and stared into the fire, unblinking.\n\nOut of seemingly nowhere there came a sudden hum of magical energy as a fae creature appeared before her, seeking her aid in a realm beyond her imagination, Stellira believing this to just be a figment of her imagination, an illusion created from her exhaustion, declined this invitation. But it seems she had no choice in the matter, the hum of magic began again and she suddenly found herself in the middle of a strange and magical forest.\n\nAhead of her a battle was raging, the fae creature hovered to her side and pleaded with her to turn this tide of battle in their favour, promising enchantments to make Stellira's hammer brim with increased power and armour befitting a champion to their cause.\n\nStellira was bewildered, she could not understand why this fae had asked for her aid and asked the fae \"Why me? Why do you choose me among all others, I am not as strong as many others out there\". To which the fae responded \"True, you are not the strongest, but you have the potential to be stronger. Please, time is of the essence, will you aid us?\"\n\nStellira, still bewildered by this turn of events, agreed to aid them. She pulled out her hammer, donned her armour and leaped forth once again into battle against a new foe. The battle was long and hard, but eventually Stellira and her strange new allies overcame the odds and defeated these adversaries.\n\nStellira's exhaustion now reached its limit, seeing her enemy retreat before her she collapsed, the world went dark and she slipped out of consciousness.\n\nShe awoke the next day and found herself in familiar surroundings, a fire crackling nearby, a soft bed beneath her, she was back in the inn of Orgrimmar. On a table nearby sat an assortment of armour, tree bark-like in appearance, and rested against the wall was her trusty hammer, now shimmering with a strange enchantment. Beside the armour a letter had been left, Stellira picked up the letter and read it.\n\"Thank you for your aid in the battle, here is a token of our appreciation and we hope you will aid us again in the future.\"\n\nStellira still could not understand why she was chosen, but put it aside and remembered her original goal, to seek out the travelling caravan of Vulpera she had heard of. She asked around Orgrimmar, seemingly to no success, until she met another of her kin passing through, they sat and talked at length of their travels when mention of this group came into the conversation. This passing traveller told Stellira of rumours that this caravan was last seen travelling to Winterspring, a cold region north-west of Orgrimmar, high up in the mountains.\n\nShe did not hesitate, Stellira thanked this passing Vulpera and readied herself and Cheeky for another long journey.\n\nTime passes, Stellira sees many new sights and new faces along her travels, finally she reaches her destination, the cold, harsh mountainous region fo Winterspring, this does not dissuade her and she continues on, eyes peeled, looking for this mysterious band of adventurers.\n\nShe hears the crackling of a fire, voices, laughter, the language sounds familiar but still to distant to make out, so she creeps in closer. \n\nBefore her she sees the caravan she had been searching for. Nervous, but determined, but steps out into the open and introduces herself to these strangers. They welcome her and invite her to sit beside the fire with them, she sits there, quietly listening to their conversation and her ears perk up as she hears about a trial for one of their members. She offers her skills to assist in this trial, to hunt a wolf that has been wreaking havoc in the region.\n\nHer offer is accepted and they venture forth to track this beast down, time passes and word gets out that the beast has been discovered, battle commences once more, fortunately none were injured in the encounter and one of the Vulpera named Grachell, finishes off her quarry in a dazzling display of honed swordsmanship.\n\nWith the trial completed, they return to camp and regale tales of old, a re-enactment of Arthas, a name previously unknown to Stellira, and here our journey now begins anew.",

He attempts to keep himself straight at all times. His elbows and knees, while suffering from some degrading, is far from as rotten as most of his kin.\n\nWhere he lacks the most flesh would be his hands, his fingers like claws and his hands are clearly made for the task of the tinker and stalker.\n\nHe appears very sickly thin, another indication of his body still in the proccess of slow decay where lack of food has brought him down to a minimal weight that doesnt seem to hinder him, just work in his advantage with a more agile figure.\n\nHis usual leather grab is that of the Deathstalker, tight light leather with a cloak that seems to defy the very basics of gravity; floating around behind him as he moves. \n\nHis face still appears like that of a young adult. A teenager at death, and his hair was once a darker golden blonde but has ever since his death started to lose its color and now is more of a sicked mix of blonde and white.\n\nBeneath his armor, Alexarius carry the signs of one who practiced the arts of the Lightslayer. Multiple scars and charred skin, dark in its appearance, fills his entire body from neckline to his feet. Most seems to been inflicted by light based weaponry and, indeed, a way for him to build up his impressive resitance to the light and its effects on the Undead.\nAs a result of this, his head seems almost not to belong to his body what with the contrasts of the charred blackened skin against his more pale skin upon his head.\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-12:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:675d93}Personality{/col}{/h2}\n{icon:INV_Icon_Trait_Retraining:25}{col:2a9ab6} Alexarius, a man of the virtues of the Shadow with the mind of a teenager. \nReflecting his zealous belief and that of his mentor, Alexarius sees himself as a prodigy of the Shadow and as such will see others as means to an end, as well as seeing the light for the evil it has become.\nHe does mantain a hard belief of chivalry, however, and will usually be misstaken for flirting when merely expressing his chivalrious upbringing's teachings.\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-58:64:64}\n{h2:c}{col:805899}History{/col}{/h2}\n{icon:INV_Misc_Book_11:25}{col:2a9ab6}Alexarius hails from Stromgarde and was born the twin of Varissa Arrian, both children to notorious bastard son Zeth (today known as Akru) Arrian.\nAt early age, Alexarius was abandoned and spent much of his upbringing alongside his uncle Kazeon, a traveling monk.\nTogether with his uncle, Alexarius learned much of the world through first hand experience and spent many nights under a bare sky or under deck of cargo ships. As a result of his diverse upbringing, Alexarius was a sort of jack of all trades, but master of none, when he enlisted with the SI 7 of Stromwind at the age of 13.\nFrom here, Alexarius spent a few years in training as both a tinkerer and a scout for Stormwind, seperated from his adoptive father figure completely. \nAt the age of 19, Alexarius faced his demise alongside his Squadron wihin Gilneas, having been dispatched to aid the Worgen against the Forsaken onslaught.\nRaised into Undeath, Alexarius was quickly roped into an apprenticeship under Abbess Andaline Hollowheart and learned the ways of the Shadow quickly. Alexarius has served in orders such as the Moklohn Command, the Collective espionage, the Deathstalker elite Squadron and the formerly Forsaken order Hand of Agony.\nAlexarius, alongside his mentor, reformed, refined and revived the Shadow Inquisition alongside members of the Assembly of Shadow upon the arrival of the Legion.\nDuring the aftermath of the Legion's defeat, Alexarius partook in each campaign from Silithus, to Ashenvale and eventually the burning of Darnassus. Later he partook in the battle of Lordaeron but refused to retreat and was missing in action for months as a result of his reluctancy to give up the homelead, chosing instead to partake in hundreds of hit and run tactics across Lordaeron and Arathi until he eventually resurfaced in the Warrior city some half year after the fall.{/col}",

					["TX"] = "\nVoice Ref: Michael Wincott (Death, Darksiders 2)\n\nKylarias was born into the lesser known House Hirorithal, notable for their long years of service within the Farstriders ranger corp, Kylarias followed the footsteps of his father and mother, joining the order. For years, he protected the Kingdom of Quel'thalas, thwarting any attempts on its borders from Amani raiders. He participated in the Second War, defending his home from Horde invaders. It was here that he gained the bulk of his accomodations and feats, outshining his peers in his effectiveness in battle, becoming a decorated member of the Farstrider order. As the Horde suddenly pulled back without notice, he joined the Alliance of Lordaeron and chased them down, finally putting an end to the Horde's reign of terror in the Eastern Kingdoms.\n\nOver the years after the second war, Kylarias travelled with members of the Alliance, mopping up any Horde presense left in the land, sending the survivors to internment camps where they would be contained, eventually becoming a foot note in history. The Quel'dorei then returned home, taking up his old role in securing their borders from the dregs of Amani still left after the war.\n\nPeace, of course, did not last long. The Scourge, during their seemingly unending expansion within the Eastern Kingdoms, arrived on the door step of Quel'thalas. While their true goal was unknown, he joined arms with the Farstriders in what would be the final time. Despite the best efforts of all Quel'dorei from ever walks of life, the source of their long lives and very beings was sacrificed to raise a powerful mage in the form of a Lich. Their King dead, lands in ruins, Kylarias lost friends and family during and with the aftermath of the attack.\n\nPrince Kael'thas Sunstrider rose up, putting hope back onto the table. When the call for volunteers was put out for people to venture into unknown lands to find a cure for the ailments of the now Sin'dorei, Kylarias would have been amongst the first to pledge his sword to the cause. He left his children behind with his brother, travelling with his partner in hopes of finding a better life.\n\nShortly after, Kael'thas allied himself with Illidan Stormrage, an unknown figure that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. This Demon Hunter was able to cure the Elves' magic sickness, introducing the Fel. The Hunter also offered to train the Sin'dorei in his ways. The Prince sent Sin'dorei off with the Kaldorei to their fates. Kylarias and his partner were one of many.\n\nHe trained at the Black Temple, going through his trials, little by little, the Elf he once saw himself as was crumbling with each passing day. When he was considered ready for the ritual of binding, Kylarias felt ready, but also fearful of what was to come. A Wrathguard appeared. Armed with only his will, he fought like it was his last battle. He just barely brought the demon down, only having enough strength to consume the demon's heart. Like many of his peers, after consuming the flesh and witnessing the demon's memories, he was subjected to madness. He clawed out his eyes in desperation, but he did not stop there. He had to be stopped from doing further damage, almost completely ripping his head apart. The newfound strength building up and the absolute fear he felt almost killed him. He awoke in the temple, his sight gone, but replaced with something else. He chose to wear a mask to cover up his twisted visage, keeping it a secret and only revealing it to those he trusted.\n\nAfter finishing his training and rites, he joined his newfound Illidari bretheren in taking the fight straight to the Legion. They fought from one charred world to the next, sending demon after demon back to the Nether. Side by side with his partner, they sent back tens of demons for every life lost during the attack on their homeland. Their battles were short lived, however. The battle-sister of the demon Kylarias consumed had tracked him down, singling him out in the chaos of one attack on a Legion world. The Shivarra drove the two away from the heat of battle, capturing Kylarias' love. The demon toyed with her, inflicting as much pain onto her as Kylarias did to her love. When Kylarias managed to track down the two, it was too late. His love was too far gone to save. It was at this point Kylarias lost the only the thing keeping him attached to his people, discarding the feelings of, as he put it, mortals, vowing to remove every demonic trace from the cosmos.\n\nHe fought in Mardum during the penultimate invasion, returning to find his master dead. The Wardens who dedicated their lives to tracking down the betrayer quickly turned the Illidaris' powers against them, locking them in Fel crystals and burying them deep in the vaults, ensuring that the Illidari would not fufill their destinies or carry out their objective of the Legion's complete fall.\n\nThe years after this were lucid, often remembering slight sights. The dank, dark room he was placed, the silence. Fleeting moments of his past flashed in his mind, reminding of him what was and what he had lost. As the years went on, the Illidari almost lost whatever hope he had left of breaking free from his prison, content with remaining in suspended animation for eternity.\n\nWith the Legion gaining another way into Azeroth by way of Gul'dan, the warlock of a far flung version of Draenor that had somehow made his way to Azerothian soil, the Wardens were left with little choice, breaking the Illidari free to combat the Legion. Kylarias used this opportunity to rip the demons apart, fighting across the Broken Isles, popping the bubble of Suramar, fighting his way on the Broken Shore to drive his glaives deep into the Tomb of the Dark Titan. He fought on Argus, taking the fight to the Legion and aided in any way he could to end the rule of Sargeras forever.\n\nThe Fourth War brought with it a lot of contension. He was Illidari, the wars that the denizens of the world got themselves were of insignifcance compared to the grander scale, but he also felt bound to the Sin'dorei. The very people that he first left the confines of home to ensure that their legacy lived on. With this, he decided to dip his toe into it, never truly declaring his alliegence to the Horde or the Alliance, but stepping in the methods used went too far.\n\nWith the revelation of the Banshee's true motives, the end of the war and the instantanious rise of the Black Empire, he lent a hand in the peacekeeping operations and routing out of Old God influence within the Horde's borders. It was with the end of the war that he got into touch with his fellow Illidari, banding together with them once again to effectively and directly enact Illidan's will.\n\n(WIP)",

But do be warned the story is quite long if you decide to read it!{/h2}\n\n{link*http://imgur.com/uN3JheX*Headshot by Teallinum}\n {link*https://imgur.com/BWdH2mf*Art by Zaggums}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/izE5i9W*Art by myself}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h1:c}{col:b38345}The Dunes{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:8aff83}Life started off like any others. Rallena was born in the warm desert, Voldun, and lived her life just like any other little one. \nHer and her people travelled along the sands in their small caravans, collecting and trading with whomever they happened to pass on their way. \nMany years went by like this, and Rallena had grown bigger and reached the mature age. Her parents obviously weren't as young anymore, but they still kept their heads held high. That was until that one day, the Sethrak ambushed their caravans.{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:b8893e}The Sethrak and slavery{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:8aff83}Everything burned, their homes had been taken from them in just a split second. Many were slaughtered, including Rallena's parents, but a few was taken and brought to the Setrak's camps, Rallena with them.\nIt was mostly the younger Vulpera that were taken, they suited best for the upcoming slave trades in Voldun.\nRallena was sold to quite a wealthy Sethrak. Her job was mainly cleaning blood and bodyparts from her now former people. They were tortured before they lost their lifes in the most brutal way.\nRallena was determined to take her life back, she wouldn't let anyone control her as they pleased. But then the days got longer and more painful. She had been suffering from various punishments that had left her arm all cut up and bleeding horribly. The fur around her neck was permanetly gone due to the tight iron collar she had strapped on her. She was giving up living, the pain and suffering was too much for her to bear anymore, until..{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:b8893e}Freedom{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:8aff83}One night the Sethrak that held Rallena as slave, had accidently left a small iron tool near her where she was chained up by the collar. She pulled it towards her with her tail, and tried to pick the lock. After many attempts she managed to open the lock, and she felt a glint of hope inside her.\nThis was her time to escape, but how? The Sethrak was asleep in their chamber, so she had to be quiet. \nSilently approaching the exit she stopped and thought for a second- \"I can't let them get away with this...\" She found a Sethrak sword hanged on a wall nearby, and grabbed it before entering the Sethrak's chamber. To prevent alarming any others, she covered the Sethrak's mouth and slit it's throat, giving it a slow and painful death.\nRallena was free. She dropped the weapon she had used and looked down at her hands that was covered in blood. Shaking and feeling all the agony slip away, she shook her head and quickly ran for the exit of the chamber. \nFinally in the dunes again, free from chains, free from pain. She was free.{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:b8893e}What happens now{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:8aff83}Wandering for days in the dunes, Rallena came across a group of small Vulperas. They took her in and helped her recover from her wounds. The group was travelling to Kalimdor to settle down and help this so called \"Horde\". Rallena had no clue who this Horde was, but she decided to travel along with them.\nThey arrived at Orgrimmar the main city of the Horde. All these strange races that Rallena has never seen before, was suddenly everywhere to be seen. She had a strange feeling, but she was ready to accept whatever that were to come her way. After all she was free, no longer a slave but the scars she carries will always be a reminder of the past.\nShe decided to cover up the missing fur around her neck, with a black leather collar, and carried on her exploring in this new land.\n\nThe adventures go on!\n\nUpdate: Rallena was accepted into a new caravan family. Though she may still be a new snout around, she very quickly took a liking to these new people she had met. Some have already become dear friends to her, and one a warming flame to her life.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h1:c}{col:da0a0f}Quick personality check{/h1}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ff514c}Rallena will do anything to keep her friends/family save. If sacrifices were to be made, then so be it. She doesn't walk around with swords as a joke.\nAs a former scout, she knows her tricks and how to get rid of a threat easily\nDon't see her as an easy target.{/h3}",

Wearing a necklace and many different rings, one that can be indentified with a seal on it matching the family crest of the Shar'Tal.\n\nHis equipment seem to be taken good care of. The ones with knowledge in bows would recognise his a bow gifted to Rangers with excellent marksmanship and of high rank within the Ranger Corps. He also carries one sword on his back and a long blade at his side. The sword has two rings tied to the handle by white and blonde hair.",

Flawlessly ageless like all elves are; short nose, striking ears and slim lips. She almost appears regal and elegant - yet makes no effort to show that pretty mug off.\n\nAnother accessory from her craft hangs around her toned neck muscles by way of a chemical mask typically worn by alchemists whom dabble in the experimental. Those keen with the forces of the arcane could even detect the use of abjuration magic.\n\nBeyond that, Shae'lendra is an iron fortress of lean muscle bound tight and taut beneath an - often dirty - strained sleeveless white shirt and a tough leather overall that looks thick enough to block heat and arrow point alike, stretching all the way down to her legs. Most of that is hidden behind of her blacksmithing apron however; stained with constant use, it too was made of a rough leather as though it was fresh off the tanning rack. It even has pocket on the front!\n\nWhile every sinew of her being has trailed through a complete workout day in, and day out for hundreds of years, this does result in a body not exactly lady like - not nearly as curvy or amatory as some of her kin. The only few hints that there was a woman beneath all the dirt was the curve of her chest.\n\nHer right arm is completely concealed beneath a huge padded smithing mitt from the shoulder down; fastened with metal bands all the way down, spaced out in precise increments and enchanted with more abjuration magic more commonly seen in wards. Its place on her arm seems tightly secured even further with a harness that reaches across to her left side. It wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. As such, her right arm appeared far larger by mere virtue of the mitt's size; yet all her fingers still moved appropriately inside of it, and the dexterity of which has not been compromised somehow.\n\nMeanwhile her left is far less interesting; scarred and marred with burns, cuts and bruises that reappear in different places each week, while her mitt came up just before her elbow - loose enough that her hand could slip out of it with ease.\n\nFinally was the craftswoman toolbelt (beneath her apron) which carried everything one would expect from a smith - tongs, chisels, clamps and measuring instruments all of varies sizes. Alongside other tools that appeared a little out of place - bottles and vials containing what looked to be oils and salts. And of course hiking nearly all the way up to her knees were a pair of heavy duty boots that did nothing to conceal her approach or departure the way the stamped and clanged around.{/p}",

Her chosen style is to have her hair loosely curled and set to appear as though not a strand of it was out of place. Like the majority of her kin, she takes great pride in her appearance and makes an effort to look her best at all times. \n\nHer face looks relatively young and remains unscarred. Her teal eyes seem somewhat brighter as they contrast the colour of her hair and her lightly tanned skin. Her cheeks and the bridge of her nose are heavily freckled.  Her resting expression is a small and welcoming smile, a reflection of her personality. \n\nHer posture reflects her pride in herself, always formal and making herself look elegant. Feynaeli's tone of voice is soft and calming when she speaks. \n\n{h3:c}Clothing and Jewellery{/h3}\n\nAround her neck is a necklace with a pendant attached to it, the pendant itself would be an orange crystal. In certain lighting it might be noted that the crystal changes colour ever so slightly making it appear to have flame-like colours. \n\nTowards the tips of her ears are three pairs piercings on each side. In the middle of two small diamond earrings is a slightly larger piercing featuring an emerald. \n\nOn her left ring finger is a golden wedding ring, small and elegant in design. \n\nFeynaeli’s robes are beautifully tailored and appear to be in very good condition. Her robes crafted by her own hands. It should be noted that embroided on the sleeves of her robes is the sigil of her House. Two phoenix's with their beaks touching, their wings spread behind them with flames coming from them. \n\n{img:Interface\\FlavorImages\\BloodElfLogo-small:256:256}",

This is also deeply contrasted by the skinless-jawline of his lower face, that which reveals itself as his association to the unliving.\n\nAbove all else, he is often found wearing an expression of vague amusement, never quite taking anything or anyone too seriously..",

Threadbare in places, outright torn and fraying in others. Covered in a myriad of uncounted-for stains. His boots are worn, his gloves are cut off at the fingers. And over it all a travelling cloak with a deep hooded cowl, under which he wears a mask of cloth over his nose and mouth. Just in case. \n\nIt’s rare that anyone sees the face that lies under the hood, but not impossible. Dark curls are messy and caked in grime, falling around a pale-skinned face.

And his attitude. \n\nA once pleasant and mannerly young man time has tested him and the results have fallen short of his former glory.

She is also rather slender, her body considered petite. The second thing noticable would be the overconfident posture the elf presents, standing upright with self pride and certainty. Her naturally fair skin is incredibly pale but also very well maintained as it appears healthy even though it is pale. No scars or marks plague her skin, it would be rather intact.\n\nHer features are rather feminine. Starting with a slender and petite nose. Her large upturned eyes which take the form of a classic almond shape but lift at the outer corner, shine brightly with a fel green and more often than not are graced with a dull, uncaring gaze. Her eyebrows are neatly maintained, slim and have a delicate arch towards the outside. The females straight and slightly pouted lips generally have no smile upon them but rather a neutral expression.\n\nDark, smokey eyeliner outlines the eyes, framing them and drawing the most attention seeing as they contrast with her pale skin and her straight and well maintained locks of pale blonde hair which reach her shoulders, recently cut. Parted to the right, the fringe covers half of her right eye. The hair is silky to the touch and shiny in appearance.\n\nPierced with large golden hoops in the lobes, her ears are long and slender like most of her kind. The earings shine beautifully adding more glamour to the elf. A black, silky choker is around her neck. A long golden chain hangs from her neck with a red gem shard. \n\nWhen her voice is heard, it is low and sarcastic sounding and sometimes even monotone with lack of interest. Though, at times she has a more emotion filled voice, mainly when happy or upset.{/col}{/p}",

The Cataclysm still hangs heavy on Grizzik's mind and, having thrown himself into rescue efforts both in Stranglethorn and Tanaris, he continues to contibute to Booty Bay's restoration today.\n\nNaturally, the persona of an altruistic, patriotic politician-wannabe is all a front.

His build is muscular yet athletic and fit which contributes to his agile movements during the combat.\nWhen he speaks his demeanor emits a noteworthy calmness and sobriety, only that his voice has a deep and hoarse tone.\nAt the one who may stare to long at this Ilidari, somethimes he can return the attention in a form of a mischievous smirk, which the observer may recieve as the distinct feeling that something else may rest beneath the surface, a mild teasing or charming nature probably connected with a inner nature he shares with his entity.\nHis skin is light taned and scared from various battles, etched with jagged midnight blue wards of mundane and arcane sort that keeps the chaotic fel energies and demonic presence at bay.\nHis head adorns long platinum mane which drapes the torso. Usually kept long and wild it reaches the bottom of his back, decorated as well with pair of ram like horns.\n\n{h2}{col:00ff00}Gear / Weapons{/col}{/h2}\nThis demon hunters customary attire consist of the \"Ilidari\" battle armor, a combination of metal engraved demonic details, leather and fur, styled in elven fashion.\nThe weapon choice are mostly his striking warglavies, yet at times he uses twin blades enhcanted with demonic runes. \nThere is also a hunting knife designed in Ilidari style, well  hidden at the side of his boot, and occasionally there can be noticed a coiled whip hanging from the  left side of his waist, the weapon remnant left from his demonic entity.\n\n{h2}{col:38ff51}Art{/col}{/h2}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/fx0DnmS*Dana art by @freakyxwannaxbe}\n{link*https://imgur.com/h6Iftzm* Dana doodle by me}\n{link*https://cdn.hipwallpaper.com/i/99/8/JOWFgI.jpg*Demonic form reference}\n\n\n{h2}{col:00ff00}Achievements, medals {/col}{/h2}\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/555824927119245342/699662807742021774/horde-silver.png*Twiligh Hills expedition}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/674960451767107614/691700602559791145/medalNowords.png*End of Days - Assault on Pandaria campaign}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/636013256435302408/721843580431368222/TwilightEnd-VoidPortal-Emblem-2.png*Twilight Star campaign}\n\n\n{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/232878*The Fel Hunt AA}\n\n\n\n",

She possesses elegant futures  and holds a neat and clean look about her. Her long red hair usually kept tied up in a ponytail behind her and her face usually holding a calm and pleasant voice. Some might find her nowhere near perfection. Her form being deformed in places with various different scares. Those able to tell knowing they came from burns and blade. \nHer general image is one of calm patience with a  clear, light and pleasant voice (Silvery) being her main way of speaking. \nSaying she is in shape would be an understatement. She wears the signs of somebody who is well in shape, having a very proportionate and strong form, but not an uncanny amount of hulking muscle. She keeps herself well looked after, and it shows in her health and appearance. \n\nIrelia could be considered young by some, but by comparison with some races she is nothing of the sort. Irelia would be an elf only just stepping into the full age range of an adult elf. Her lifespan long enough to have experienced a many few things. \nHer early days would see her raised in a small part of Quel’Thalas with her parents and family. She was not born into nobility or high wealth, or much of a high standing family in general. But she was ambitious, and wanted to contribute so much more to those around her and to the kingdom she lived under. She was able to get herself into priests of Quel’Thalas from a young age, serving their people for over a century with her powers of the light. Her ambition driving her up the ranks of the priests and priestesses, serving their people in that time in whatever conflict or issues she was called upon to assist in. \nBy the time of the fall, she was a strong and confident elf possessing a large amount of skill in the use of the light. However, when the attack hit and her powers faltered, she could only stand by and watch as everything she treasured and swore to protect burned before her as she stood helpless as the scourge tore through her family and hometown as her fickle powers no longer responded to her calls. \nWhen the call for Blood Knights was made, she was one of the first to answer. Joining under Lady Liadrin with revitalised determination, taking control of the light herself and fully taking up sword and shield in service of her people. Using her old skills in the light along side her quickly forming skills in melee combat, she stood by the Blood Knights, fighting to take back their home. After this however, she vanished.\nNot much is known about what happened in her years of solitude, but she returned a completely different person. Her drive and determination gone. Just a shadow of her former self. She was fortunate to find herself in the company of those who cared. Those who took her from her path of self implosion and restored her back to her former self. Finding new friends and family, she stands tall alongside her husband and household in defiance of those who seek to bring harm to their people. \n{/col}{/p}",

Her skin, fair tanned, is almost silk and matching to touch with a flawless complexion. Her face fits an almost stunning soft structure with angled features, her face being framed in an oval shape. \n\nHer hair, light platinum blonde with the appearance to sometimes altar pale white in some lightning, is long, reaching down to her tush. Is kept tied up in an elegant braid, neatly framing the tip of head. A single golden winged brooch is snug into her braids, revealing a ruby gem eye detailing the image of a phoenix.\n\nAn inscribed golden rune is written at the top of her left cheekbone, over the bridge of her nose and to the top of her right cheekbone. The inscribed rune is framed on the bridge of her nose with golden lines, starting in line with her eyes and ending just below the rune. \n\nContrasting her youthful appearance, her expression usually rests with a warmth, mature embrace. Welcoming those near. Her golden hues beam ever bright with her connection to the sunwell, delighted composure only matching the light of her own eyes. {/col}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485086703648768000/716645783407165531/Knae_Belf_priest.png*Lovely Art by ForgedFromVHS}\n{link*https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeSP2IUWAAMOwZP?format=jpg&name=900x900*Great art by @Eliz0r }\n{link*https://twitter.com/AURIGAE8/status/1315780974341431297/photo/1*Gift from a friend, by @AURIGAE8 <3}\n{link*https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ek97RUnWMAAg6LA?format=jpg&name=4096x4096*Hallow's End outfit!! by @topikoji}\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/759672048372678676/787768211612499998/GIObueC4.jpg_medium.jpg* Cute gift from friend!}\n{link*https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Er8YlhYXYAMAUOs?format=jpg&name=4096x4096*Absolutely gorgeous art from Makkochi @_glittergoth\n}\n\n",

Kora would then travel back to Outland and living back out in areas of Nagrand and Blade’s Edge Mountains. In this time she would get a mentor under a Blademaster, earning a very special trick known as windwalking, where the user becomes so adept and agile that they can move so quickly that they appear to be invisible to the naked eye.\nYears later, her mother would die from a sickness in her sleep, leaving Kora to find her only living relative and joining the Terrorhymn Clan.\n",

However, Vordren is not anymore impervious to damage as a comparatively powerful demon hunter, meaning that he has survived catastrophic, horrifying injuries that would have destroyed many... at the cost of his sanity. \nNevertheless, it is not all doom and gloom. Peeper gives Vordren enhanced eyesight and an eidetic visual memory, making him very skilled at drawing extremely accurate representations of anything he has ever seen.  \n\n{h2}Personality{/h2}\nPoised, disciplined and pragmatic, Vordren believes in self-reliance above all else.

Her eyes have shed their former Fel corruption and instead glitter warmly like gemstones.

She is also adorned with silver earrings; one in the helix of her right ear, two in the left.\n\nUncaring about her impression, Lissera tends to wear worn cloth and leathers that, unsurprisingly gives her the look of a delinquent. Comfort beats style. Usually this means she wears a black crop top with whatever else she deigns appropriate.\n\n\n{p:c}\"She's responsible for our Rumsey stock taking a dip.

Can set objects on fel fire temporarily. Made from the remnants of the shattered daggers Orasi used while growing up.\n\n\n- Blood infused dagger [Unforgiven Bite] (By Elizis the San'layn)\n\nThe dagger which sucks the blood out of a wound the moment the wound is made. The blood is consumed to empower the dagger and make it even more deadly in combat, as long as the blood is flowing, the stronger the corruptive dagger turns, making it pierce defences easier, be it magical or physical. Rotten or undead dried blood does not empower this weapon.\n\n\n- Dagger made of a rotting bloodstone [Last Memory] (By Magmaros)\n\nThis dagger corrupts wounds it slices open or stabs within. It has no quick notable effects during combat other maybe some sort of exhaustion or numbing of the area around the inflicted wound. The real deal with this weapon is that it leaves a wound that cannot by healed naturally, only magically. The untreated wound causes rot and even necrosis the first day, and by normal means, death the second. Enough time for someone to leave or re-live a last memory.\n\n\n- Twilight dagger [The Unexpected] (By story progression)\n\nA dagger that does not exist unless one of Orasis twilight vials is consumed. The dagger then may materialize whenever is necessary to strike. This dagger seeks to consume light and void, life and death from its targets, its one of Orasis strongest weapons. There is a time limit on this dagger though, for when the twilight effect wears off, it dematerializes.\n\n\n- Elementium sword [Moonstalker] (By Squire Balthein)\n\nA sword made of elementium, rather big in size yet peculiarly mastercrafted and enchanted to be very light. It has three empty runes on it, ready to be enchanted and imbued with further powers. A weapon still at the making.\n\n\n- Enchanced boots, a blinking spell is cast when she is frozen in place, not really good at using the automated blink yet. (By Mal'Thadian)\n\n\n{h1:c}{col:8a0e15}Other features{/col}{/h1}\n\n- Any voice going directly to her head, be it a whisper or a scream, hurts her mind immidiatelly, might get agressive.\n\n\n- Partially soul burned, permanently weaken her.

Her father was constantly blaming Orasi for her mothers death, yet he also trained her to fight with all kinds of weapons, axes, swords, bows, anything that could kill would be enough reason for her to learn it. Orasi loved dual wielding her two daggers and she became an expert with them.\n \n\nYears passed, at her 17 she was following her father in assassinations and thievery, her father stopped training her since he saw he couldn't teach her anything more, she had became much more of a better fighter than him.\n\n \n\nHer father grew jealous of her, in his mind, Orasi not only took his love away from him and now she became better than him. He didnt love his daughter and left her one night, alone, in the woods of felwood where they had camped. Orasi woke up one day completelly alone.\n\n \n\nOrasi was left, she didnt know what to do. She felt lost and abandoned. She stayed at the camp that whole day, waiting for her father. Yet he never came and  what little hope she had to find him was lost.\n\n \n\nAt the very next day, she got attacked by a demonic beast, a fel hound. The fel hound ravaged Orasi, almost at the point of killing her. She managed to slay the beast, only out of a purely lucky blind swing of her dagger, but her mentallity was shaken from the demonic attack and her father abandoning her. She left of wounded to find her father.\n\n \n\nFor 2 years she has been searching for her father, and she finally found him alone in his small camp after she heard some rumors from a nearby village. She went close to her father, caressed his cheek while he was sleeping and then whispered \"You will never leave me again\". Saying so, Orasi butchered her father with her knife and left the body there, except his skull, which she carried into her secret lair and placed it on a skull altar she had build the last 2 years. \"I will grow my family, i will bring you all more company, dont worry you sillies, we will all be together forever\"\n\n \n\n\"Forever\"\n\n \n\nOrasi wasnt the same woman anymore. Something changed inside her. She was already killing people for her 'family' altar, to grow it bigger. Yet after she killed her father, she felt alive. She didn't want to hurt more people to take them in her 'family' but she never stopped loving the people she placed in her altar. She stayed away from cities and generally people for a lot of time, not only because she was wanted dead literally everywhere, but also because she started getting attacked every night by demons while out in the open, the demons werent assaulting her when she was in a closed area, in her case, the cave. \n\n \n\n1 year passed without killing or meeting anyone. All this time she started feeling worse and worse, something inside her was pushing her to look at her daggers and use them. 'Kill, you need it' She started to hear a voice in her head. She really felt she needed it, she was afraid of the voice. She didn't knew who or what it was. She refused to kill, over and over again for a whole month, each day the voice getting louder. \"Worthless..\" said the voice. She started feel what the voices wanted her to feel. \"You want to kill. You will kill. You love to kill\" she heard. Orasi smiled and nodded to herself, or the voices she was listening to.\n\n \n\nThat night, she sighted the closest village to her location and murdered one knight, two women and a child. When she finished and took their skulls she snapped back to normal, the daggers fell from her shacking hands as she saw the four skulls infront of her, on the ground. The voices were sated, it wouldnt pester Orasi for now. She took the skulls with her, since she couldnt give them back their lives, she would love them as her own family. The 'family' grew by 4 members that day.\n\n \n\nThe next need to kill came half a year later. She satisfied it.\n\nThe next one 1 month later. She satisfied it.\n\nThe next on a week. She satisfied it.\n\n \n\nHer need to kill became daily very soon. If she didnt kill someone each day, those voices would start pestering her, claiming her body and mind slowly. What are the voices? She never learned, but now, they are part of her.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-ZinRokhDestroyer:512:256}\n\n\nPeople killed and skull collected(Most recent at bottom): \n\n1: Vengy

However along with his over the top attitude he can be quite the loving person in his own silly and stupid way. \n\nHe is extremely loyal to his friends and loves all of them. Even considering a select few as his real family, be they Goblin or other. He cares for all of them, even stepping out of his way to make them happy.\nZaxzil enjoys people who can take a joke and have fun and not get offended. He would often make a joke about his own appearance and life just for the sake of making people laugh. \n\nAlthough Zax can come off as an oblivious goof ball he is actually quite smart. Knowing his way around most, if not all machines and equipment. He is known for making things that even he can't explain afterwards.\nEven though Zax enjoys making things, another of his passions is blowing things up, whether that be buildings, people and so on. He knows his way around any sort of explosive from a grenade to a rocket and if someone were to mention the word explosion or bomb. It would send him off his rocker and he would probably try to blow something up.\n\nBeside his goofy and comedic nature he can also be quite serious when the time permits, however a joke may pop out every now and then.\nZaxzil isn't afraid to speak his mind, if he doesn't like something or someone he will say. For he might as well say it now to save the pleasantries for the next time. However his mind might be swayed overtime, just like any other person.\n\nAlthough Zax is an all around lighthearted and humorous person, he has his moments of dark thoughts and loneliness, however he usually buries these feelings as he would rather people not see him this way. Zax only opens up to people that are close to him and have earned his trust, such as the people he calls family. \n{/p}\n",

Moving down his face he has a narrow bridge heading to a sharply pointed nose sometimes flaring his nostrils when he speaks, his thin but darkened lips twisting into smirks showing his fanged teeth, the skin here is also cracked like near his eyes, these cracks are distinctly marking his skin with inky sable discolouring, they stretch until they fade not reaching his angular chin.\n\nHis neck is long and elegant, leading down to his compact shoulders that are held straight and upright so that his collar-bone is jutting out, the bones sitting under the ashen skin - his torso is long but slender and remains preserved like all of his body, in fact it is impossible to find a bone that has torn through his flesh, not even along his long, spidery arms - his hands are large and spindly, infact his fingers seem unnaturally long with strange enlongated blackened claw-like nails still sprouted from them, it is notable that his palms have the same likeness of cracked skin akin to his face, some even extends along his right-hand's wrist. He has incredibly long and lean legs, reminiscent of elven heritage as he stands on agile, narrow feet that allow him to walk almost airlessly from place to place. The thing that doesn't make sense is that he seems to hold only the faint smell of ash to his skin, like burnt out wood.\n\nHis attire is rather interesting, the colours are a contrasting shade of deep purple and dark grey, along with a dark metallic thick filigree that match the accents of his armor, the robe sports a high collar he pulls against his neck, it is notable that he seems to wear various small-boned necklaces tucked under his robe but visible, the latest addition to his necklaces is what appears to be a mixture of silver, onyx and amthyst coloured beads, decorated with a unholy tentacle wrapped eye - the shoulderguards are strapped down to the robes, decorated with spikes and chiseled out holes that emit a faint void-like essence from within them, the belt matching in design and keeping his robe hinched tight so that it doesn't slack, the robe has two upper spiked legguards fused to the sides, protecting his upper legs.\n\nThe staff he sports looks as though it was made from a gnarled branch, thorns and bits of dying leafs sprouting from within the wood which has started to turn grey - there is some deep purple cloth wrapped around the upper part of the stave then twisting up to the top, tying down a large skull that wedges the scythe head into the wood, the metal looks as though it is sharpened regularly though has a small chip in it - the skull's eyesockets are glowing faintly.\n\nWhen speaking, he has a rather deep and husky voice - he sounds quite cold and calculating most of the time, often trapsing into full on stone-cold when he is angered.{/col}",

A copper wire runs down the length of it, the ends are attached to a gizmo on the handle and another near the tip. The electric charge it delivers greatly increases its effectiveness - especially against larger targets.\n\nFastened to his belt are some sticks of dynamite and a battle axe, adorned with some teeth. Very large teeth.\n\nSwung across his shoulder is a makeshift flamethrower, which was obviously built from scrap metal and doesn't look very safe. A fancy dagger is fastened to the tip and functions as a bayonet.\n\n{icon:garrison_greenarmor:30}\n{h2}Gear{/h2}\n\nMost of the time, Pekun wears sturdy plate armor. Recently aquired a newer more fetching one.\n\nRarely he's seen with a helmet, opting more often to wear his goggles into battle, for the advantages they give him.\n\n\n\n{icon:inv_helmet_goggles_pandariatradeskill_d_01:30}\n{h3}Goggle features{/h3}\n- Night vision\n- Spyglass function\n- Magnifying glass\n- Experimental fog-nullifier\n- Heat vision\n\n\n{icon:inv_misc_bag_09_black:30}\n{h3}Satchels{/h3}\n\n{icon:inv_firstaid_bandage:25} {icon:inv_misc_bomb_03:25} {icon:inv_misc_enggizmos_swissarmy:25} {icon:inv_tailoring_80_nylonthread:25} {icon:inv_inscription_parchment:25}{icon:inv_archaeology_70_highborne_noblemansletteropener:25}{icon:inv_misc_rope_02:25} {icon:inv_misc_enggizmos_rocketchicken:25}\n(Inventory detail \"soon\")\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-83:64:64}\n---\n{icon:achievement_goblinhead:30}\n{h2}Looks{/h2}\nA Goblin of average hight, but physically fit as his profession requires, Pekun would look to the casual observer like the typical bruiser type.\nRecent battles managed to accumulate more injuries, and thus scars, than all his years as a merc - fighting highwaymen is obviously very different to fighting wars.\nSome cuts and burns are visible (but not obtrusive) on the Goblin's arms. Should one catch him without his armour though, one would find several stab- and shot wounds marring his torso and legs.\n\nPekun's ear-cuff is concealing a sizable hole where a chunk is missing from his right ear. This is obviously the only scar he is actively trying to hide.\n\n\nHis armor is usually kept in good shape. The unobtrusive necklace, sporting several large teeth and claws, that dangles around the Goblin's neck, as well as his single nose piercing, are the only jewellery he wears (aside from his ear-cuff).\n\n---\n{icon:ability_racial_bestdealsanywhere:30}\n{h2}Personality & Quirks{/h2}\n\nPekun tends to call people descriptive nicknames instead of using their actual ones.\n\nHaving spent most of his days as a neutral merc, he doesn't have a lot of faction pride for the Horde. But he's fiercely loyal to his friends and will go through hell and high water to defend them; be it against physical harm or merely verbal offences.\n\nLike many goblins, what Pekun lacks in physical size and strength, he makes up for with his ingenuity. Which is why his spear is modified to increase it's effectiveness especially against larger targets. He loves to tinker, especially when faced with a problem that needs to be overcome. One of the results of this are his patented one-time-use rocket-propelled mail-chickens.\n\n---\n{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled03:30}\n{h2}History{/h2}\nAsk ic ;)\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Wetlands:256:128}",

It is a sharp disparity to her dark skin, coloured so that you could lose her in the shadows of twilight.\n\nWhile lighter on her blush than many of her fellow Suramarians, Velravyn always keeps herself made up with mascara and foundation. Her clothing has become far more practical than her homeland; when not in her armour, she can often be seen in high-neck shirts, thick cloth pants and calf-length leather riding boots. This exposes her incredible collection of scars, from face to feet, including a trio of wicked marks over her right eye and a stark circular ring about her left forearm. Her back is by far the worst, a horrific torturer's canvas of white and black lines twisted into stiff valleys of scars.\n\nHer hair is kept clean and bound in a cloth-wrapped ponytail and braids, the loose ends either tucked beneath a rugged old hat or a bandanna to ensconce her ears, both of which are missing their upper halves.

Her voice, {link*https://youtu.be/WomoIywubm4?t=349*worn hoarse through the din of battle, is a low and appeasing contralto} clearly crafted in its cadence for the polticial battlefied of the Court of Stars.\n\nHer sharp eyes belay a keen cunning and intelligence, transmitted often through creative sarcasm or warm humour. She has a natural Suramarian confidence to her attitude and body, though seems for the most part to keep her pride in check. She often affixes her sentences with polite titelage, using, 'My dear,' to those within her circle and addressing others by rank or last name.\n\nTo those who know her well she is a friendly, warm face who will give all she can. To her enemies, however, she is known as a terrible and brutal opponent, a cruel imagination sparking behind those ever-thinking eyes.",

Here and there, her armour is accented with elements of Suramarian military flaire.\n\nBuilding her own armour piece by piece, the Nightborne wears a light Orcish warharness over her stark blue tattoos. During campaigns, a strong plate neckguard is added to her ensemble for a little extra protection. Standing out amidst her sleeker is a heavy pauldron bearing the skull of a felled Proto Drake. Mounted upon her back is her Sashimono – {link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/232649*a warbanner bearing the sigil of the Crowblade.} The sigil depicts a bird poised for combat with the recognisable Burning Blade held in its beak. A delicate shal’dorei transmutation rune encircles the bird and its weapon. Atop the ironwood banner, bound with red cloth, sits a trio of dark trophies. A gilded Demonic Inquisitor's skull is nestled into the apex, a crudely carved Imp-skull hanging just below it by a similar sash while a third rests below of a much larger, similarily horned creature. All have arcane permanance runes engraved into their brows, preventing them from returning to the Nether.\n\nThe rest of her armour is comprised of light, layered drake-plates. Borne over one shoulder is the skull of a felled Proto-Drake, it's plates matching those of her taloned boot-guards and the ornate taloned gauntlet strapped over an arm. Her legs are armoured with a dragonscale kilt hanging from a bulky warbelt. The unearthly white shimmer across the dead ebony scales indicate they once belonged to an Infinite Dragon. Shimmering arcane feathers poke out from underneath their leather thighguards, giving the high-sitting leg armour more of a flared, slimming effect. These scales are held up by a sturdy belt that is bedecked with pouches and a handy first aid kit. \n\nOn her hip, bound by a blue Shalassian Silk sash, {link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/246413*the ancient Elunite steel blade, “Anaris,” sits within a crow-feather sheath.} The Orcish symbol for 'Fire,' is painted over the metal finishing connecting the feathers to the mouth of the scabbard, an ornate rope sword-frog holding the sheath to the sash. Draped over the metal mouth is a rope tassle, bearing a twilight blue bead, a perfect pearl, and a third gem of the two melded together in a perfect eclipsing moon. A jade bead hangs from the tassle itself, the maker's mark supporting the rest of the blade. Any familiar with Azshara’s Expansion Wars against the Troll Empire would recognise it and its elven details such as the crescent moon pommel, and the Qiraji Obsidian eclipsing guard. Those with a keen eye would recognise its forging origins as both ancient Mogu and Pandaren, the latter clear in the blade's form and the Cloud-serpent styled metal collar just below the guard.\nTo the Zandalari Empire and Trolls of old, it is a wretched blade rumoured to sever a troll’s connection to their Loa.",

Wide shoulders, broad chest, strong-boned frame with well-defined muscles. Yet he still moves with grace and deliberation - although he seems slow in his actions he covers the ground swiftly enough. He 'occupies' any area he is in, seeming to fill space around him with the assured awareness of a top predator.\n\nHis hair is a thick, fine, creamy blonde with white highlights, if unbound it falls in heavy locks down beyond his mid-back.  It contrasts against the tan of his weathered skin.  He has light stubble beard along his strong jawbone converging into a trimmed goatee on his chiselled chin. His ears are somewhat thicker than the normal for his kind, folding backwards, more reminiscent of Kaldorei ones.\n\nThe eyes are ocean blue, their irises dark in cloudy weather and vivid in light. The deep-set eyes gleam with live fire and the lines of a grin are cut deeply into his face so that the merest twitch of a smile sets them darkening. They look out with a stern expression: this is an old-style man, macho and disciplined, sombre and self-contained.\n\nWith the ease of longevity that all elves have this one still looks like he has been around a very long time.{/h3}\n\n{h3}{col:181dff}Clashing with his serious demeanour and appearance he wears some less conservative jewellery, such as a flat golden ring in his bottom lip, a silver stud through the middle of his tongue and two small rings in his left brow. In his ears he has two industrials crossing each other.\n\nSuryan has a masterwork of a tattoo, a pair of red-inked wings on his broad shoulders with the realistically detailed feathers ending at his elbow.{/col}{/h3}{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-ArcaneStorm:512:128}",

And no I will not get nude only so you can see the bruises. Maybe if you ask nicely *winks* I could give a little peek. (bruises include claw marks on his back and stab-like wounds on his butt cheek(stabbed by stingers of huge wasps and scorpions))\n\nIm normally a good guy, but get on my bad side, and you'll be seeing hell.

Well, just as most Vulpera I come from Vol' Dun. I came with Kiro's Caravan but I decided to leave them in the middle of the road, because I thought I saw something interesting. Turned out to be a dragon's lair. A dragon chased me for soo long, I got lost in a swamp and had to find my way to Orgrimmar alone. But while on the way I stumbled on a goblin outpost. They were pretty cool people. They thought me a few things about engineering (mostly explosives) but then they pointed me the way to Orgrimmar. And you are like why didnt they attacked me or something since I was new to the horde and they might not know?\n\n{col:ffffff}Interviewer{/col}: Yeah, how actually didnt they have any suspisions of you?\n\n{col:ff3000}Terry{/col}: Well apperantly I was lost for quite some time and they have already met with some Vulpera. We had our goodbyes and I went on my way. Eventually I got to Orgrimmar. And wadda ya know, Kiro actually didnt forgot about me. He waited at the front of the gates! Boy I was soo happy to see a familliar face. He showed me around a bit, I got settled in, and had a really long nap. The End.\n\n{col:ffffff}Interviewer{/col}: Well Thank you, Terry thats all we needed.\n{col:ff3000}Terry{/col}: Yo welcome!",

Production increased, forcing him to work longer hours. Although a tough life, Drarkan never once complained, and only till the day that the foundry was assaulted by Frostwolf Clan orcs and The heroes of Azeroth, he had not had a single day off. \n\nHe saw little reason to resist the attackers and laid down arms. He chose to rather live to see another day and was captured.\nDue to being less of a threat and not participating in the war, Drarkan was released into Draenor once again.\n\nHe wandered through Gorgrond till he heard of a settlement with Mag'har, having orcs from all the clans gathering, and he'd take the opportunity and seek it out.\n\nHe found the place and was accepted into the group, and under the leadership of Geya'rah, he found himself in a lifestyle a bit less stressing than what he was used to.\n\nThe peace this new tribe had endured was short lived, as the Lightbound draenei ended up attacking their settlement. It was there, short after the attack had started, that a green orc came, telling of a way to survive, and as he activated a device he possessed, he'd create a portal into another world.\nDrarkan was one of those to enter, and this took them to Azeroth, where a new life owuld unfold for him.\n",

After the brutal conflict in Highmountain, he and his people joined the Horde, and ever since he has been a loyal follower of the Horde and the Highmountain tribe.\n\nPersonality Traits\n\nKulin usually has control of his emotions such as rage, unlike many other Bloodtotem Tauren. He also isn't as xenophobic as most Bloodtotem tauren are. Though he is xenophobic at times.\n\nWeapons & Armor\n\nHe wears mostly mail armor that also has a bit of leather in it. It also has a few of his trophies on his armor. Such as a Basilisk head, a spine of a crocolisk, and a tooth from what seems to be a wolf. He uses a bow and arrow alongside a skinning knife. He also owns two brand new Bloodtotem totems on his back. \n\nFourth War:\n\nKulin served in the Arathi Highlands and fought in the battles and skirmishes in the campaign. He was stationed at Hammerfall and carried out his duties as a marksman of the Honorbound legion. His last days were when he took part in the battle of Stromgarde. After that he and his legion retreated and a bit later the armistice was signed and the war was over. And after that, he and most of the legion were shipped home and a small garrison was left at Hammerfall.\n\nScourge Invasion: \n\nHe didn't really experience the amount of undead as the capital cities did because he was in Highmountain. The scourge were few in Highmountain allowing him and the Highmountain tauren to dispose of the invaders. \n\nGoals:\n\nFinding his younger brother who is exiled to to the Feltotem betrayel and venturing into Stormheim.\n \n\n",

Phojan Storn sat alone next to the lit firewood endorsing the silence amidst mutilated corpses that ably dressed the grass red. The scent of charred wood, cleaved grass and disturbed dirt overwhelmed the sense of smell and diluted the odour of blood. Each and every of the lifeless carcasses had one thing in common; a white tabard dressed with one red emblem on its center.\n\nHe glared into the fire as if in a trance. His mind drifted off to fragmented memories of a former life — their unclear meaning haunted him. He saw a house ablaze, cries of panicked cattle and pillaging bandits fleeing the scene. Caught within the inferno a woman reduced to a black husk. The remembrance played on repeat rapidly flashing his mind by over and over again until a roaring spark from the campfire brought him back to reality.\n\nA grunt came from the tied zealot near Phojan. “Took your time. Slept well?” The woman struggled to get on her feet until she realized she could not.\n“What do you want? Please, let me go!” she pleaded realizing the fate of her comrades. Phojan bluntly tossed more firewood into the fire. “The three households your lot unjustified captured implored for their release too. Yet you butchered them without second thought.”\n\nThe zealot protested with a snarl. “This land belongs to us! They were in the wrong for not b—!” Phojan sharply disrupted her as he rose from his seat and drew his sword. “For not being human? How ironic it is that you forgot your humanity.” \nThe zealot predicted her fate and entered a state of panic. “If you were to kill me then why didn’t you do it earlier!?” He lifted his weapon for the imminent execution.{/col}\n\n{col:cb0015}“I wanted you to see it.”{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff}Who you are looking at is Phojan Storn; a dead man with a high sense of justice. Little does he recall of the man he once was in his earlier life but vague memories, values and a great resentment towards misdemeanour. Whence risen from eternal sleep he declined the offer to serve the Dark Lady and took it upon himself to make his purpose a path of his own. Staying true to what fragments he has left of himself he dedicates his afterlife to uphold the purposes of order where the long arm of justice would reach thin.{/col}\n",

If one is considered fortunate enough to be out of her range of fire or too close for her to shoot, do not consider yourself safe, for if her reach cannot touch you, her wolves certainly will, starved before battle and hungry for a meal.\n\nOnly animals are safe from such methods, their hides more valuable when intact. When asked why she would follow a rather dishonourable form of combat, she is quick to remind those around her that honour in combat is reserved for those who prove themselves honourable and worth a good death.",

He has alabaster skin with fel green eyes and has short blonde hair, his facial expression often neutral. Despite this, his demeanor can be carefree and youthfull outside of the field of danger.\n\nAs a blacksmith, he maintains most of his own armour but crafts little from scratch. The only piece of armour he possesses that he has crafted himself is a replica of the Blood Knight armour, forged from Dark Iron to add a resistance to fire, no longer being active as a Blood Knight however, he is rarely seen in this. As a blood elf there is some inherent pride in him which manifests in upkeeping his armour, sometimes seemingly obsessed by quickly repairing any blemishes to the armor, even those that do not threaten the integrity of it. Upon entering most battles, his armor is spotless and looks as if it was freshly forged.\n\nA pouch is rested on his waist, mostly filled with alchemic concoctions, trinkets and potions. Having forsaken his mining carreer to persue the alchemic arts after discovering the usefullness of the properties of alchemic potions. He often carries some revitalizing potions on him, rather it be for health or mana. \n\nHaving been active outside of Quel'thalas since the opening of the dark portal into Outland, he has seen many battles and has fought for many factions, this has acquired him many sets of armour everywhere between light agile armour to heavy duty plate. Often wearing the colours of those factions depending on the set of armour he is wearing.",

					["TX"] = "{h3}Description{/h3}\nSmall in stature and unassuming, this young vulpera could possibly be overlooked or missed in a crowd. Whilst this is sometimes preferred, she more than makes up for it with her bold, vivacious personality.\n\nHer wiry frame is covered in a pelt of short, sandy fur broken up by sleeves and socks of dark brown. Spots of the same colour can be seen over her shoulders, ears, back and tail, perhaps reminding one of markings similar to that of a hyena. Short, dark claws upon her paws are kept sharp and her long muzzle is usually set in that of a cheeky smirk or toothy grin.\n\nNoticeable facial features are dark, stripe-like markings on either side of her snout, small spots gathered in a group at the base of her nose and a mark underneath her left eye.\n\nEyes of amber are large and bright, taking in every detail they possibly can and enhancing her desert-born appearance. They are full of intelligence and almost disarmingly intense. Her tufted ears are tall and wide, front-facing and always in an instinctual state of alertness.\n\nThe way that she carries herself, her adventurous personality, confidence and love for jokes, story-telling and music hints of a great passion for performing arts. She lacks airs and graces, yet speaks in a smart and practiced silver-tongued manner. Underneath that jovial exterior, however, there are often hints that she can be just as fiesty and vicious should she want to be.\n\nFull of life and almost boundless energy, she is definitely no introvert. Whilst not intentionally grating, she may be difficult to handle for some, even if she does genuinely mean well.\n\n{h3}Equipment & Inventory{/h3}\n[WIP]\n\n{h3}Background{/h3}\nWith the recent joining of the Horde, the Vulpera have ventured to lands unknown. Jerru, taking the opportunity to explore the world beyond the sands of Vol'dun, now revels in the bounty of discoveries awaiting her in her new home. Hoping to make a name - and coin - for herself, she embarks on her own adventure, relying on her wit, guile and cleverness to survive.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-Islands:256:128}",

Small eyes that emit a bright orange color, set thightly within their sockets, watch blankly those that approach her.\n\nThe characteristic pale skin could only be seen due to her neck and face, otherwise most of it is covered by armor.\n\nAn otherwise lithe frame, not too tall but not short either. Despite that, a slight athletic sense is at hand, a sign that this one exercises regularly.\n\nThere's something different about her, perhaps it's her eyes or the general blank expression, an expression of the fearless, but also of the lifeless, as if her spirit wasn't quite within her body. Nonetheless, she seems to be talkative, somewhat approachable. What thoughts flood her mind during a conversation though is another story.\nOne could only guess her age, by the looks of it, Narestra seems venerable, obvious wrinkles beneath her eyes give it up.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}{icon:inv_chest_armor_bloodelf_d_01:25} Narestra sports an old, yet otherwise powerful arsenal. A robe, adorning the obvious colors of black, red and gold covers everything, from up her neck to her boots. Enchanced silk cloth with the purpose to keep her warm during cold nights and cold during warm days.\n\nCloth isn't the only thing she sports though. The obvious shoulderpads that cover her shoulders and even below, her biceps, are made of hard reinforced steel, pretty much durable than the common shoulders. Its secret for the durability was the triple quenching of the incandescent item, afterwards dipping it in oil, which made them more durable and gave the steel pieces a better shape. Obvious, feather-like shapes, along with what appeared to be the face of an eagle on either shoulderpad. A symbolic figure of the house Bloodcrest.\n\nThe same applies to the obvious chest-plate in front, which extends from Narestra's upper chest area to the middle of her abdomen. This thick piece is kept together with another thinner piece that protects the Sin'dorei's back with neatly tied leather straps painted red.\n\nConcluding, her gaunlets, the front part of her belt and her heavy boots are made in the same way. Heavy, which would inevitably decrease her speed, but durable enough to protect her numerous times from equally heavy attacks. Both magical and melee. Specifically, her gaunlets have sharp-nail parts. Making her able to claw in melee distances.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}Apart from the armor, Narestra's arsenal sports eight specific and obvious gems. Enchanced gems that act for defense and retaliation.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}At times, Narestra carries a burning sword in the obvious Light energies and a shield. The sword can be sensed to have a strong Light aura, same with her shield. Pretty uncommon objects, hardly destroyed.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n{h2}{col:d29037}Abilities{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}{icon:spell_arcane_rune:25} -Through the passage of time, Narestra has acquired knowledge and means to use spellbreaking abilities. Able to toy with a mage's focus and flow of thought, directly assaulting the mind, overwhelming it with means necessary to make one forget spells temporarily, thus rendering them useless. Narestra uses her sword as a conduit of such terrible anti-power. Apart from the strong Light aura, mages will sense a menacing, chaotic enchantment. Bearing resemblance to a Fel enchantment, though that doesn't seem to be the case due to the Light. It is a strong, spell-stealing enchantment.\n\n{icon:achievment_raid_houroftwilight:25} -Apart from the anti-magic techniques, Narestra radiates a warm, major aura of Holy Light. An antithesis if one gets to know her, as Narestra isn't the typical paladin, that seeks to use the Light for the greater good. There is something far more selfish, chaotic situation to that. Yet, the Light is summoned, pointing out Narestra's unbreakable willpower. Willpower for her own goals. \n\n{icon:inv_ember_fel:25} -Narestra has a sort of an adept knowledge about Fel. Inevitably, she had to cross paths with its energies for survival, yet she refused to practice it more other than just survival. No spells, demons, soul-stealing can happen. Yet, she is keen on detecting demonic auras that associate with Fel.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n{h2}{col:d29037}Story and House{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}A long one. Only a few can reach that deep. There are stories, songs, legends, traditions. Yes, there are - however Narestra doesn't seem willing to reveal any of them.\n\n{icon:inv_misc_book_10:25} Despite that, Narestra has a keen eye for ones that can serve her house as mercenaries, ones that are searching for contacts, acquaintances, mages and paladins alike.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n{h2}{col:d29037}OOC stuff!{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h3}{col:d29037}-OP?

In those days Viroz was not much more than a bodyguard, or as her siblings seemed to think, a meat shield. \nAn attitude formed and molded by her past this one is often at odds with those around her, being unable to regard many as more than an aquaintance. Those who knew her in the past few years may notice her once firm walls starting to crumble down, a vague conscience drilled in by the efforts of a close few. \n\nAs of current Viroz scours over the lands seeking a path that suits her, her lack of skills and a inability to hold back often closing the door on many chances.

Now, though, she's far from it. With an emotional range so shallow as to make Maiev Shadowsong appear kind and caring her grey and slightly emaciated visage is nearly always twisted into a vicious sneer. Undoubtedly undead, once blue eyes burn a bright crimson in stark contrast to her palid skin and the flesh of her lips has turned an icy blue. A natural hourglass shape due to her feminine skeletal structure, her body has lost it's lushness in undeath and she appears a touch on the gaunt-side.\n\nIt is rare for her to be seen without the tell-tale trappings of her vocation worn for all to see. Invariably, with it's hood pulled up, the undead ranger dons a lengthy cape that is more than a little ragged. The hem of it displays damage with the threads fraying whilst the main body has a few holes. Alongside this, matte black armour clings to her form consisting of chainmail and thin plate that affords some modicum of protection despite leaving her midrift exposed in classic, elven, style.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}History{/h2}\n\n{col:FFA71A}In life, Valestra Emberflare was a ranger of Quel'thalas. Day in and day out she stode through the enchanted woodlands to keep her home and kin safe and sound, keeping the Amani in check and honing her skills in the wilds. And now, in death, she is a Dark Ranger fanatically loyal to the Banshee Queen.\n\nWhen the orcs came to burn Eversong to the ground she had her first taste of true war but it was not until Arthas came that her world was turned upside down. The Farstriders lead the defence of Quel'thalas and fought a desperate rearguard action but the tide of shambling corpses could not be stopped. Her arrows found eyesockets and rotting hearts but still the Scourge came to ravage Silvermoon. Though brave it was for nought and her broken body was piled onto a corpse wagon just like so many others. She knew the peace of death, for a time, until her tortured soul was raised as a banshee to serve Arthas and her old superior Sylvanas in undeath.\n\nOvertime however, the Lich King's grasp weakened and waned and many of the undead regained their freewill. Sylvanas and her banshees lead the rebellion against the dreadlords and the Forsaken reclaimed their existence. Valestra however was less than happy. Just as the Ranger General had done she sought out her own body and possessed it, wandering the world as a pale skinned and red eyed monster. All too keen to inflict her agony upon the living she turned to mercenary work - all the better to spread terror.\n\nIt look many years for her to come to terms with what she was but eventually she did. She bent the knee to Sylvanas and became a Dark Ranger, joining with the Forsaken and the Horde to enact her vengeance upon Arthas in Northrend. She has served faithfully ever since.\n\n... Until Sylvanas betrayed her, and the Horde.{/col}",

Sabelon was no stranger to this,  and it took him proper time to adjust correctly to the ways of the Horde full and proper. By old Grimtotem standards, he's considered a soft touch, which is pretty telling.\n\nA Sunwalker, not the first under Aponi but in the first numbers that emerged.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance and Personality{/h2}\nSabelon is, very obviously, a Tauren. There's little difference between him and the standard Tauren outline you'd get. He's very tall, broad and strong. The bulk in his frame allows him to wear almost cumbersomely heavy armour with relative ease, and his weapons are usually large enough to be as tall as those of other races. When not using a brutally hefty Warmaul, he'll use a nasty axe and a shield as large as he is. Traditionally, his armour is in darker colours, of coppers and bronzes, reds and black and leather straps. With Sunwalkers lacking a true set of armour to call their own, he sticks with more Tauren/Horde styles of equipment.\n\nHis mount, Groundshatter, is a heavily armoured warbeast of a kodo, built and trained for battle more than anything. Tenacious, loyal and almost unstoppable on the charge, traits he sometimes wished he had more of, himself.\n\nPositive traits include a sense of honour at a base level, and a Grimtotem sense of agency in that one should act when opportunity arises instead of laying passive. Whilst his attitude (and sense of humour) can be dry, he's fairly no-nonsense and will state things as he feels without skirting or dressing up topics to avoid them. He respects the men that fight with him and his enemies, and holds himself with integrity: he refuses insults of those in his tribe and will stand up for subordinates without hesitation. Sabelon respects the Earthmother to a degree and honours tradition, as well as things honoured in ancient times. He's willing to work with enemies against a common threat, and has an open distaste for backstabbing and deception\n\nNegative traits include being somewhat abrasive and stubborn in his worst moments. Grimtotem ruthlesness creeps into him when he'll quicky take to less savoury and \"honourable\" tactics, such as striking downed enemies or even bombing them from a distance. Whilst he understands mercy, he doesn't often have it. He's openly racist against Dwarves and High Elves. He's not above browbeating or using his authority to get what he wants, though generally speaking that's never normally something actively harmful to his allies.\n\n{h2:c}Miscellaneous{/h2}\nHates littering. Keeps clean, bathes twice daily usually.\n\nExercises/works out as a hobby and a way to unwind.\n\nSometimes stares off into space without realising.",

She was born to parents who were both servants to a wealthy noble, so her early life was kind and easy for her.\nHer mother passed away in an accident involving the Master's menagerie of exotic beasts. The resulting trauma drove her father to drink and he passed a few weeks later, falling into the canals around Suramar.\n\nOrphaned and not being in good stead with her parents' master, she was passed on to her godparents, a couple who had once been friends of the family. They ran an arcwine distributory on the front and an illegal fighting ring behind it. \n\n{h2}Young Life{/h2}\nThere isn't much one could do in Suramar before the barrier was dropped. You either studied, laboured or lived in luxury. For Tei, it was maddening. Grieving for her parents and having seen most of the city in her few decades as a child, she took the first oppurtunity she could to patrol the Arcway with the Duskwatch. \n\nThe training and fighting helped keep her discplined for a while and it brought more money into her adopted parents' business. Eventually, not even a century into service, she was dishonourbaly discharged for an alleged affair with her commanding officer. Which of course, never happened. \n\nThe fact she was low-class and was moving like a rising star through the ranks made her the target of embittered nobles who wanted to be the shining stars. The rest, is history.\n\n{h2}Post-Duskwatch{/h2}\nAfter being fired from the army, Tei went to join her adoptive parents' fighting ring, excelling at fights and picking up bits and bobs of using weapons, small amounts of magic and hand-to-hand combat. All this experience was cultivated across three centuries, during which time she aided those she could.\n\n{h2}The coming of the Legion{/h2}\nWhen the barrier fell, Tei, like many, were incensed at the decision to bow before the Legion. She joined with the Dusk-Lilly rebellion and aided in the fall of Suramar's elite. Despite herself and her kind-hearted nature, she slew the Master who had been responsible for her Mother's death. She had been ordered to capture him, but her thirst for vengance and the oppurtunity proved too much.\n\nWhen Suramar fell and rose from its own ashes, Tei was lost. Her adoptive parents and their home had been destroyed in the final days of Suramar's civil war, many of her friends and family butchered by the Legion's Demons purging out those dens thought to be sided with the Dusk-lilly.\n\nShe was lost and alone.\n\n{h2}After the Legion{/h2}\nTeinithra stayed in Suramar for a few months, eventually getting the chance to eat the fruit of the Arcan'Dor, freeing herself of her addiction to the Nightwell. She busied herself with labour and work, but each night sleeping alone in a tent with other displaced Shal'Dorei slowly drove her away.\nOne night, she used her savings to take a boat going anywhere and slipped away into the night, watching until the jewel of ancient empires slipped over the horizon.\n\n{h2}Pandaria{/h2}\nThe Shal'Dorei was in awe when she got off the boat in the Jade Forest. She had never seen so much green! Nor felt so much heat... \nThe next year she spent wandering around Pandaria, infected by a wanderlust she did not know she had.\nShe eventually entered the tutelage of Tian Monastery and began learning how to manipulate mana and chi to create the mists of the Jade Serpent. Combined with her centuries as a street-builder, Tei finally started to put aside the demons of her past.\n\n{h2}Now{/h2}\nWith her training advanced enough that she can call herself a 'Mistweaver', the Shal'Dorei continues to wander the world, experiencing something her great-great-grandparents could only have dreamt of.\nOh and a good scrap. And good drink. Anything to enjoy this new and bright world.",

Kemala stands tall and proud. With shaggy brown fur and thick, crude, plate armor.\n\nPhysique: \nThe tauren. Tall, hulking, noble creatures. They tower over the other races of the Horde. And Kemala is no different. Built like a literal bulldozer, this furry mostrosity of dense bone and powerful muscle will charge clean through any barricade and knock aside anyone standing in her way.\nDue to being mostly muscular with little fat, her chest and hips are not as defined. They are clearly feminin. But, not THICC.\n\nKemala has shaggy fur. Brown with beige spots and belly. Although, clean and well tended. The fur will remain coarse and shaggy. Her hooves are adorned with hoof irons on the bottom. Hammered in with iron nails.\n\nHer fur is painted in tribal warpaint.\n\nFacial features: \nKemala's golden eyes are set in a frown. Just the shape of her face really. Her snout is long, with large nostrils. Her teeth clean and white.\nHer sharpened, black horns frame her features well.. Often used to gore those who don't get out of her way fast enough.\nShe has warpaint on her snout.\n\nHer brown mane is shaggy and ruffled. It is decorated with eagle feathers and blue beads. Likely trinkets dangle from her horns, ears, forehead, and around her neck.\n\nEquipment:\nPlain, thick iron armor, decorated with Thunderlizard horns, thunderlizard hide and mountain cougar hide.\nMaintained often enough, it does show signs of battle. With scratches and broken off spikes.  \nShe carries with her a large axe. The oakwood handle resembling a staff, with the stone axehead emblazoned with earth runes!\nOn her back, she carries a Kalimdor oakwood totem. The totem itself imbued with the power of Earth!\n\nOn her hip she has what humans consider a large backpack. A pouch to Kemala. The fur, leathery satchel, decorated with feathers, is filled with equipment for travel. Rope, food, a waterskin, a skinning knife, a leather tent.\n\nArt:\n{link*https://imgur.com/OGLJYgT*Art1}\n{/col}{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TrollDrum:512:256}",

Gif created by @East_Owl_}\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/zfXH0rJ.jpg*The Doctor Is In! Created by Leandroyepyep}\n\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-HytsGYg0*Character Theme: Epitaph - King Crimson}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}Braindrinker was perhaps not your typical picture of a friendly, professional or even vaguely trustworthy Doctor. That was because her methods of healing were often downright barbaric. Though functional. Primarily utilizing first aid and alchemy in her own special way - she was actually a rather competent healer, if one can bare the pain of having her treat you. She did not grasp the concept of painkillers.\n\nThe first thing you'd likely notice about Braindrinker was her mask. Marking herself as one of the Laughing Skull Clan. A twisted skull mask forever grinning - masking this woman's visage behind the amused smirk. This skull wasn't as well decorated as others might be. There were a few bones and teeth hanging from holes she had drilled, but it lacked gold which was so often added into these masks.\n\nTopped with black feathers and fur - the mask blended well into her own dark hair, almost being difficult to distinguish, granting the mask a faintly haunting reality to it, as if it really was the face she was born with. Though within the dark pits of her mask, the dull brown of Brain's own lips was visible, that too, often curled into laughter. Her eyes were bright, eccentric, but a looming red which could be seen as intimidating to those easily shaken.\n\nPhysically, Braindrinker was your average Orc. Perhaps somewhat on the shorter end in terms of height - but regarding muscle, she was packing. Meaning that her threats always carried the weight of brawn behind them. That was not to say she was a brute though. Far from it. While she was like any Orc - prone to her outbursts of bloodlust, despite her apparant insanity - she was  exceptionally cunning and tactical. Often leading foes to underestimate her intelligence. \n\nThe clothes she chose to wear made her stand out among even the Laughing Skulls. She didn't wear the average scantily clad leathers and would often be found in full-fledged clothing, elegantly made and either Elven or Human looking in its design, protective and well-fitting, clearly especially made. She almost appeared to look like a Pirate.\n\nRegarding personality, Braindrinker was... Odd. That was saying the least. While most Laughing Skull were nothing but entirely insane savages, Braindrinker was... Different. That was not to say she was socially acceptable. She had no problem engaging in barbaric acts, but when she wanted to reveal her cards, she displayed surprising elegance in vocabulary and great education regarding the world as a whole. But, that didn't change her clan - and she still carried much of their values. \n\nDespite not looking the part, Braindrinker was actually a healer. She was skilled enough to patch wounds, mend flesh in the heat of battle, treat soldiers and nurse them back to health after the fact. Primarily using first aid and alchemy to gather ingredients from her surroundings and convert them into healing substances. She was fully literate, and often read various medical books. She did have a PHD... However, it was one she had stolen from a corpse, and written her name over the original recipients in their blood, presumably.\n\n {/col}\n\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwhtCgR_oQU*Click me.}",

He stands at an even 200cm which is emphasized by the way his frame wears his body: shoulders tightly back, cleft chin forward and up, his chest\nhigh. Two shining eyes polished by fel-fire establish dominance over his face, laying beneath a thick brow ridge and two impressive black brows. A latern-jaw weighs everything down. His face is latticed by a collection of scars which vary between skinny and sleek to jagged and raised. His countenance is justified to an aquiline nose with a bridge that has been clearly broken and reset many times.\n \nHis body, tangled between thick pieces of matte plate and brass-buckled leather straps, is packed with hard muscle. His bulk seems to fill anything that tries to restrict him: the top lacing of riding boots, thin coats, tightly-wound bandages. His wrists are thick and sturdy, his legs are tear-dropped by muscle bred from marching, and his hands are guarded by thick calluses. His chest is bannered by ironed tabards of Silvermoon or its sister-factions. Hanging from his waist are leather sheathes which case damascus shortswords and onyx spearheads. A black riding crop knocks against the side of his leg as he walks, commanding and sleek.\n\nSpeaking in a grizzled tenor, his physical presence is well-bolstered by his words, nearly all of which are spoken in Thalassian. His Orcish, grudgingly given up, is strained through gritting teeth and a heavy accent.\n\nNotes of cardamom, pink pepper and amberwood wrap his body neatly, topping off such a ruthlessly proud and hawkish man with a soft dollop of inherited elegance.\n\nA true Sin'dorei if there ever was one.\n",

Like a proper Vulpera, Teejo's waistline is plastered with items that fit onto his belt. Bags, waterskins, pouches. Magical or mundane, he keeps lots of items handy.

However it’s difficult to see a face as attractive when it bears dangerously deep scars and wears an eternal mask of thinly veiled contempt. And it’s tough to admire eyes of deep jade when the left is a sickly deep red color like old blood.\n\nThe thick, heavy plating of his armour is immaculate. He is never seen out of it and appears unhindered by its considerable weight, as it if formed an integral part of his heavy frame.\n\nHooked in his wide, heavy belts are a score of trophy hooks, a few of them always sporting a freshly claimed extremity, be it a hand, ear, scalp or similar.\n\nHis right arm is completely replaced by an arcane mechanical construction. The limb itself has been crafted in a dark grey metal, it is sleek, streamline and incredibly well made. \n\nScattered along key parts there are fel stones surrounding a larger blue stone that glows brightly with the arcane energies. These are positioned around the top of the biceps and also a set above the wrist. Around the index finger, a chunky gold ring with fel stones embedded within has been perfectly merged with the digit as if it is both wearing it and yet it is clearly fused with the metal.\n\n The hand itself is eerily lifelike, holding a liquid grace to the craftmanship, the fingers themselves look as if they could be real if they were not tipped with subtle claws.\n\n The shoulder is capped with smooth metal that spans partially onto the chest and armpit to lock it in place, the skin around the prosthetics attachment point is raw and scarred from where the skin has been pinned over the metal to allow further security.\n\n The arm looks perfectly lifelike until you see the two ball points at the top of the arm where it locks into ball sockets in the shoulder. \n\nWhen attached, the sheets of metal cover these ball sockets and joints to leave a perfectly smooth expanse of metal in a series of segments that look almost like armour. \n\nThe limb itself seems to show muscle definition, these areas even flex of move like real muscles when the arm moves or fingers flex.\n\n It looks almost like someone has simply painted metallic grey over the mans arm it is so realistic if not for the segments and sheets of metal merging together to allow flexability.\n\nShould one attempt to find something nice to say about him, it might be that he appears well-groomed, especially when it comes to his long, white hair which would easily brush along the ground, should he ever bow. \n\nA keen observer would notice that he appears corrupted on a deeper, more sinister level. Black veins can be seen on his visible skin, yet has not yet reached his neck or face.\n\nIn the event that someone saw him in a state of undress, they would him completely covered in a thick layer of scar tissue, both fresh and old. Although many scars are of a warlike origin, it would be impossible to conceal that most of them, especially on his back are stemming from a hand exceptionally skilled in the use of whips and blades.\n\n Even so, one can see within the remains of his ruined back, a tattoo which seems to shift, to writhe and breathe as the magics within it still function. It used to be in the image of a city of almost alien origin. Yet the destruction of his skin has rendered it nearly impossible for anyone to tell, save those who might once have seen it in its full nature.\n\nA large black tattoo is covering his left arm and shoulder, the design tribal and seemingly of an arcane nature.\n\nDemonic and Fel runes cover almost ever inch of his torso and arms, seeming carved, tattooed and branded into his flesh, crossing over scars. If anyone takes the time to look at them closely, there are thousands of them, the reasons for them unknown. ",

Any monk could tell about her Chi, and a sign of discipline within. For one who channels the mist to heal anyone suffering, she's been taught the selflessness of helping at the price of her own life energy. Her gestures and energetic personality often resemble her mood, hence she can be easy to read in these circumstances.\n\nTrained under the wisdom of Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, she takes all teachings at heart, and holds them dear to herself, for they shaped her for what she is now up to this day. Her fighting style obviously resemble those of a mistweaver's.\n\nWhenever speaking Orcish or Thalassian, there is a weak, but noticeable Pandaren accent following through every sentence.\n\nHer body is well trained, and she does keep an active lifestyle to maintain it as such. One could say she might even be passionate about that, which makes her far from the usual feminine figure most of the time.{/col}\n\n\n\n{h2}Criminal Record{/h2}\n{col:2aa876}Kylerane along with two of her companions have been arrested by the grunts of the Fourth Legion and incarcerated within Orgrimmar barracks. She has been found guilty of theft of medical supplies and lying to the interogators about it, thus receiving a 'fitting' punishment for it. More details lie withing the record papers!{/col} {col:ff3b49}(And if you'd like to find more or wish to look directly into her records, hit me with a whisper! Not for meta purposes, of course.){/col}\n\n\n\n{h2}Yu'lon's teachings and the Journey of the Mistweaver{/h2}\n{col:2aa876}Trained under the wisdom of Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, she takes all teachings at heart, and holds them dear to herself, for they shaped her for what she is now up to this day. Her fighting style obviously resemble those of a mistweaver's.\n\nAfter several years of training, she is ready to take her rightful title of Mistweaver. Pursuing the trials under Master Hyu'ji Jadesong's guidance, she takes the test to prove herself and the skills she's been taught up until that moment. Upon succeeding, Kylerane is given the staff she gets to hold today; the ironwood infused with the Chi make a powerful ally against steel or can grant her the vitality whenever she seeks it most to heal her allies. Among other students alike in the Temple of the Jade Serpent, Kylerane is known for becoming the next follower of Yu'lon.{/col}\n\n\n\n{h2}Inventory{/h2}\n{col:2aa876}Medical Supplies: Surgical gloves, surgical masks, syringes, suture kit, injecting needles, scalpel, scissors, forceps, bandages, clamps, intravenous cannulas, tubes, tweezers, splint, oxygen mask, gauze, cotton balls, tourniquet, thermometer, stethoscope, aneroid sphygmomanometer, band aids (different colors), tape, small knife, clinical swabs and tubes, napkins, morphine syrettes.\n\n\nMedicine: Anesthetic (localized), activated charcoal, Betadine (povidone-iodine), painkiller (ibuprofen / acetylsalicylic acid), antiemetic flask, Peacebloom tea with mint and honey flask, hand sanitizer, disinfectant, sterile saline solution, ointment (mild burns, irritations), salve (wounds), distiled water, isopropyl alcohol.\n\nOther: Thirty centimeters long crocolisk tooth, A black scroll, A flask of clean water, A pair of keys, Coins, A shiny Rubik's cube, A pencil, A notebook, A snappograph, A medal, A Pocketwatch, A small black box, A disguise kit.{/col}\n\n\n\n{h2}Ring Details{/h2}\n{col:2aa876}Kylerane wears a dark, metallic ring, probably shaded silver, inlaid with jaded fillings polished to a spit shine for contrast. The ring resembles a wind serpent coiled into a circle, and holding a flawless ruby with a burning ember captured within the gem, in it's mouth.\n\nIt's safe to assume she takes good care of it and makes sure to keep it safe. A piece of jewelry with high sentimental value.{/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-mop-JadeForest:512:256}\n\nBut wait, there's more to come!

Reds as deep and vibrant as succulent rubies, oranges like the taste of pumpkin and cinnamon, sweetened only by the saturated yellow of the purest honey. It is these colours that make up the mane of the man standing with you. There is something about these vibrant strands when cast in the light of the sun. You don't always notice it at first, but when you do, you realise the vague terms we use to describe hair colour, no longer fit them. They turn into rays of morning sunlight before our eyes, swimming with a warmth and energy that projects the world with a wild light - leaves of autumn shining in the lining of deep untampered honey. If you have never seen such hair before, then you will surely notice this amongst all other things of the character De'vontae. To be lost in the flames of hair is a sweet yet energizing experience, but should you find your eyes wondering, you will begin to notice the smaller details of Firecloud.\n\nSupple ivory skin lines his chiselled countenance with silver scars and lacerations across his torso retaining a strange beauty to his physique as well as a morbid history. De'vontae has an appealingly handsome face made with a strong jawline, high set, sharp cheekbones and defined lips that curve up into a smouldering smirk. His eyes hold a mixture of holy energies from the ever present sunwell as well as the thick sickly green fel shroud that had tainted his race. Beneath this glow, you'd find an intelligence in earnest eyes that seek to understand everything around them, picking up on hidden details, seeking true meaning about what things are and not what they are meant to be. But at times a deep rooted sadness can still be found on more melancholy moments, a sadness that weighs down the elf in his stature as well as his mannerisms that give away he has been through much in his short life.\n\nIn terms of physique, De'vontae stands tall for his kin, but not overbearing with a muscular athletic body that, has twisted ropes of muscles shown along his arms and across his back and down to his stomach. This is often hidden in chainmail armour or shown off in tight leathers and cloth that set a less militant and more casual set up for the elf. \n\nBeneath the clothing is a set of stylized flame tattoos that ignite at his wrists and flow up his arms, along his shoulders and down his back, creeping along his sides and beneath his trouser line. If you were to follow them further still, you'd find a Dragonhawk spread in full flight forming the flames at his left pelvis. The reason behind these tattoos is to hide the scars of his past and the most recent scar of an eye upon his left sternum. On his left ring finger the elf has a tattoo of one autumnal Dragonhawk wrapped with its head on the tail of another more orange tinged Dragonhawk with a more male featured face. The first has wings like blood and the second has wings of fresh oranges, each touch in a circle mouth to tail creating an intricate circle and ring. This for those astutely aware is the males wedding band.\n\nPerhaps, now you have seen all you can make out at close inspection, you will move onto uncovering the person inside of all we have covered. Let us just hope you find him as charming a man as he is intended to be. Some have called him a sad living form of the brutality the elves have faced, others refer to him as a unique and wonderful character, many comment of his new found faith in the light and view of the world. What will you find in De'vontae Firecloud?|r\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-VindicaarCrystal-LightsJudgment:256:128}",

Not the introduction you were expecting to start with? Yeah, well I guess you could say that my life hasn’t turned out to be what you’d expect to have been dealt upon ‘entering a contract with mother nature.’ Think I’m being excessive? Then ruminate whilst I shed some light upon those worn out leather boots of my life you are judging prior to trying.\"\n\n\"As you may have gathered, my outlook on my parent situation is, for lack of a less colourful term, about as favoured as an abomination farting in a compacted Undercity elevator. I’m sure Esteler and Theodluin Autumnvale didn’t start off with the intention of ending in the way they did, I’d go as far as to say, they probably thought things were going to be great. But in truth, as soon as Esteler announced her pregnancy, Theodluin - my biological father, became about as useful as a knife made out of butter. He was always a coward of a man that managed to get to where he did with his lot in life by being a ‘good listener’, and that’s about as far as his talents stretched. He was the kind of guy that would inspect his shoes intently during any conversation and likely hold an explosive that was about to detonate as long as it stopped you yelling at him.\"\n\n\"My mother Esteler fell for Theodluin after a messy breakup with the local Spellbreaker’s apprentice, following a discussion about what was more important, training or her. I think we all pretty much can guess what the answer was to that question. So, done with burly lovers, Esteler fell for the docile and rather useless Theodluin - the guy who will always be the ‘safe choice’. To cut a long story short, in the run up to my graceful entrance to the world, Esteler fell for a domineering human by the name of ‘That fucking wife stealing bastard’ she met one night ‘on the road’. It took her all but the length of time it took me to pop out and wave a howdy for her to jump ship into the arms of her new human lover and run off.\"\n\n\"Theodluin as we’ve established, was about as useful in situations of distress as a spoon is in combat, but add heartbreak and fatherhood into the mix and Theodluin decided he had been called away on a spiritual quest to see the world. So, a human loving mother and a father that was more in touch with his Kal’dorei self than he was with the fruit of his loins, we’re hitting the ground running with this story aren’t we?\"\n\n\"I grew up with my father’s loyal friend Skymaster Baesh who had taken me in as his stable hand. Life with Baesh was like living with your best friend from your days at the academy, all fun and games and there for you when you needed a buddy to beat up those little pricks that went about like they had the testosterone of an Orc. But, he was never a father, and I couldn’t really expect him to have to be… I suppose the best way to describe it would be, your parents provide you with the rules of life, whereas Baesh provided the guideline.\"\n\n\"Transitioning past my voice breaking, hair growing where hair had not grown before and a large shift in the balance between which kid shits on who’s doorstep - ..purely figurative, I was at my coming of age and a budding Dragonhawk rider, still part time stable hand. Baesh had taken me on a journey out towards Kalimdor by boat to exchange a Dragonhawk egg for a substantial amount of silver. We were on our way home when our ship was redirected towards the Hinterlands following an obscure warning about there being unrest in the High Kingdom.\"\n\n\"Baesh became unsettled by this news and the fact the ship would not be returning upon its designated route for ‘some time’. It was then that he took his own Dragonhawk and we rode into the skies to head out along the coastline towards home - but just as we passed over the mountain into the region of Ghostlands, that was when we saw what had stopped our ship. A black jagged, ugly scar was being torn across our homeland, littered with flames and staggering bodies that I assumed were the ambling survivors of our race. Baesh turned us back towards the mountains nestled in the south with the intention to free room on the Hawk for any wounded he could rescue. I waited six days, foraging more than hunting, gathering as much as I could for as many as I thought he could bring with him. Naively optimistic, my stubborn youth was rewarded with the sighting of Baesh’s Dragonhawk on the sixth night, swooping and twisting back in a careful descent to the grass.\" \n\n\"I had never seen Baesh look so old as I did that night, ghostly pale and withdrawn. In a sense, my friend never came back on that Dragonhawk, the man who did was fuelled by a sorrow I couldn’t understand or even begin to console. Since this time, I have read many books, seen much scars of that battle, but I’ll never claim to share the sorrow that other’s have known. The sorrow of seeing the extermination of Anasterian and the High Elven race.\"\n\n\"Two years passed since that night, we had spent that time helping to rebuild our homeland, our minds and find a way forwards. Propaganda had begun to spread like wildfire across the survivors, telling tales of the Sunwell that we had all felt be ripped from us, like a maelstrom had opened up inside of our stomachs. But it went on to speak of horrors of what would happen to us now we could not feed upon the Sunwell’s riches. How we will become twisted forms of ourselves, history will repeat itselves and soon, we will face our future evolution, as the Kal’dorei once did to the High elves. Many jerked off this as a cruel and sickened joke from those too mad and broken to look for hope in this bleak world. Baesh was one such elf. ‘What a load of Tauren bollocks’, he used to fume as we took turns tending to whatever job we had been given that day. You see, since then, we had joined a colony of survivors, led by the remnants of some Farstriders and city Guards, making a small camp and pushing forwards blindly to survive.\" \n\n\"I wondered, why would these people be spreading such rumours and tales in such a time  as this? I ridiculed these proclaimed mad elves with many others, taunting them and throwing stones as they tried to use turned up crates as podiums. Life went on like this until news had come through the camp that Prince Kael’thas had returned from Dalaran and is seeking any able bodied to come with him to find an alternative to the destruction of the Sunwell. Promises of a new bright future spun like golden strands of the sun towards us and brought us together, binding us under our new title ‘Blood Elves’. Sin’dorei. The word still burns a fire in my heart.\"\n\n\"I caught Baesh packing shortly after the news had reached our camp, he turned to me like he had been caught cheating on his lover. His face ashamed and eyes sad and apologetic as they had become to always be since the attack. He would be heading out with the Prince and many other elves in the hopes of finding something new out there for us, as a way of making amends for what he couldn’t stop. He explained to me how I was too young to go, and I suspect if I was old enough he still would not have wanted me to. I felt the ground tumbling away from me, rooted only by the sense of reliability he had to me not to lose it. ‘Besides, they’re going to need a kid to step up and take over from an old Skymaster’.\"\n\n\"Green under the collar, I knew better than anyone I wasn’t ready to be a Skymaster, but I couldn’t say no. I couldn’t break out into that cliché scene of screaming and crying like a good boy I was meant to be, I just accepted it because I knew that was what Baesh needed. And so, Prince Kael’thas, his men and my Baesh left to what would later be, Outlands.\"|r\n\n\n|cff8f8f8f\"During this time, I moved into a turned out ruined building with a girl called Lorilae, a few years my elder, an innate ability to kick my ass in everything and stunning eyes, I was unable to really say no. It was my first interest in the opposite sex and I had no idea how to handle this strange world. I’d like to say, but don’t worry, Lorilae was a great teacher, but we went through this earlier. This isn’t exactly what you’d expect to happen. Our make shift home was made more homely by some pelts and recovered cloths from wreckage hauls, I had made a nest for a Dragonhawk egg and kept Baesh’s Dragonhawk out in the back courtyard. Lorilae and I shared bed mats often, for she suffered night terrors from the attack and I consoled her with an awkward pat and terribly misplaced thoughts about what is a bra and how does one smoothly handle the prospect of untying it.\"\n\n\"I didn’t notice the hunger and thirst for magic as many others did so dearly as it was more a background noise to me than anything larger, and I suppose being away from it at the time made matters less difficult. But Lorilae had been aspiring to join the ranks of a Magister, she was closer to the Sunwell than I’d ever be and she felt the pain like it was a physical burn on her throat. Always there, I suppose like the dead scar is to Eversong. We had all started to become thinner and more withdrawn in appearance, and Lorilae had since stopped coming to my bed mat as her hair had started to fall out in clumps. I tried to console her one night that it was simply due to malnutrition and stress, but I wasn’t trained in the world of women and didn’t know how rude it was to say ‘Hey, look, I was never fussed about your hair before, you’ll be more eye catching without it.’ Lorilae left the house and did not come back.\"\n\n\"One night, when I was on my own, I was awoken by a faint scratching sound at the door, similar to a mouse but more frantic. Picking up the leg of a broken table, I edged my way around the door and towards the shutters of the nearest window. In the light of the moon, I gently pushed open the shutter by a crack, nimbly pressing an eye to the side. Now, I never really bought into this whole mock the Kal’dorei’s Elune, until Elune decided to take a giant steaming crap on my innocence by showing me what I saw that night. So. Before I continue. Fuck you Elune.\"\n\n\"Lorilae - or something that looked much like her, stood at the door with blue bulging eyes. Her thin hunched body turned towards the window showing the hunch to be a growth of her skin upon her back which glowed a strange blue. Walking over clumps of fallen hair, she started to amble her way closer. So next time you ever want a version of a cold shower from thinking about a hot girl, well yep, that did it for me.\"\n\n\"I picked up the Dragonhawk and fled, my heart pounding as I tried to reason with my fight or flight instinct and the rationality of if this was a bad dream from hearing too many propaganda speeches. I ran out the back door towards Baesh’s Dragonhawk and looking into it’s consoling eyes, I came to some sort of realisation. It was as if this attack on the High Kingdom was the end and the part I’d been living was some cruel twist of a joke. Like letting a fish off a hook only to have it swim into a net. If I couldn’t find freedom, then Baesh’s hawk deserved to. Untethering the leather strap that held it into place I commanded it to flee - it sensed my fear and took to the skies. Thanks a lot ancestors for your decision to opt for opposable thumbs over wings.\"\n\n\"It’s safe to say I’ve not had such a bad night since then - Really? You fell for it again?\"\n\n\"News came through from month to a few months at a time from Outlands followed by the appearance of green floaty orbs in gilded chains dotted around the rebuilt city of Silvermoon, but none came back from Baesh himself. I became detached from the prospect he was still alive and instead I put my mind onto something else. Become an Outrunner. You see, our civilization may have been destroyed, but life had gone on and I needed a job and at my age at the time, I needed anything I could get. There had been a noticeboard placed up near the camp advertising for Outrunners to carry messages through the ruins of the city and even possibly down past the Dead scar - that black line that tore along our homeland I spoke about earlier. This wasn’t a very sought after job as it kind of took your life expectancy down from triple digits to two. But as such they weren’t picky about how old you were as long as you could run and follow simple orders, yes sir no sir, you tell me how many bags you want full sir.\"\n\n\"For this, I needed to move down to Falconwing Square.\"\n\n\"My interview consisted of running around a disused fountain and being forgotten about by the drunk ranger who was currently in charge of the post because he became distracted by his empty bottle. Four hours later and I was still running, he came back and laughed for another thirty minutes in hysterics but I kept running. If you ever need to work off a lot of pent up aggression and distress, do some running, unless you can have sex, both are relaxing, running is the beggars sex.\"\n\n\"My first job ended up being my only job as an Outrunner. I was given a large parcel and told that my destination was Sunstrider Isle, my point of beginning, Falconwing Square. This meant I had to run across the very long stretch of Dawning Lane that divided the ruins of Silvermoon - the place where elves like Lorilae were being disposed into, elves that had fallen victim to their own addiction. They had become to be known as ‘the winnowed’. Sometimes you’d catch elves on their last legs jumping fences to get into the ruins to join ‘tapping parties’, where the attendees had captured Mana Wyrms and started to tap into them and their blood like a drug.\"\n\n\"This, I will point out, wasn’t approved of, but usually if you had fallen so low as to forget yourself and actually begin this tapping process, you had already sealed yourself into becoming a winnowed. It was breaking into the early rays of the morning when I set off down the path, I figured they’d be less likely to lurk on the path that the Guards would be regularly seen upon during the daytime, when patrols were more often. And it was going well until I reached the first gate. Slumped over the dead body of an Outrunner stood a winnowed, hands deep in the ribcage of the body. Seeing it in the actual light of the day, I was certain they had become worse… for this creature - this thing that had once been the other side of the same coin to me, had transformed into something that makes Worgen seem like a Fey tale. It had green bulging eyes, a black rot-like mouth with what looked like black drool coming from it mixed with blood, a balding head and these pulsating green growths… It’s feet and hands were like claws, ripping and slicing up it’s meal with wiry like fur growing out in patches across its’ arms. Parts of the growths seemed to have popped for there were small holes where they should have been. It’s chest no longer followed the structure of a ribcage, instead it sucked inwards. It turned itself from its’ meal, likely sensing the prospects of what little magic I had flowing through me as a nice desert. It was then i noticed the markings near the eyes, like small slits - it just wasn’t elven anymore. I ask you now, how can we be born the same and yet ended up so different?\"|r\n\n\n|cff8f8f8f\"Fear contained the bile that had risen like a churning sea in my throat, that could be me if we didn’t find a cure. I dropped the package and fled just as I heard the screech of the wretched thing ‘So.. hungry!’ followed by the clicking of its’ claw like feet hitting the slabs of the pavement. I screamed out in turn, and I felt as fast as I could back towards the square, hearing more and more clicks of claws upon the ground. Just as I saw the barricades into the square, I was gripped by more fear, for the rangers were pushing the barricades as though to keep me out. I waved my hands in the air and yelled that I was Sin’dorei, to open up and help. And just as I thought I was forced into a corner, a bright flaming arrow blitzed across the sky and landed behind me into the body of the pursuing monster. I heard the thud of the fallen body and turned to see the gone creatures descend on the fallen to gorge upon them. Collapsing backwards, I was dragged back behind the barricade followed by shouting orders.\"\n\n\"I was relieved from my job as an Outrunner having failed my duty to take the package to the Isle and was given a few copper to go wash away the pain at the local tavern. I was still so shocked, I did just that. Throwing my copper at the barkeep, I ordered my first flagon of ale and I suppose covered in dirt and mud, the elf was beyond cracking down on things like ‘are you old enough for this?’. As I simpered into my third ale, a woman burst through the door and into the murky smoke filled tavern where many had come to swallow down the horrors that had become our lives. Tears streamed down her face and in her hands she held the remains of a shirt. ‘They’ve become wretched! They’ve all become wretched! We’re poisoned! Kael’thas has abandoned us and taken our children and left us to die!’ Punters rolled their eyes and began to yell at her to jog on, shut her trap and go put it to better use in the brothel.\"\n\n\"I’ll stress, I was very drunk at this point and young, and after what I had just seen, I wasn’t all that willing to join in the shouts anymore. Because I knew different. I pushed back by bar stool and waved my arm about the room shouting, ‘And what the fuck do you think we’re guarding ourselves from now? Where do you think people are disappearing to? You’re all blind and ignorant and remaining that way because it’s easier than admitting that we will end up like them! You’ve all felt the hunger and seen the changes on us!’ I received a club around the ear and numerous half eaten pieces of food thrown at me, at least the woman wouldn’t be ridiculed anymore. It was the first beating I had taken since I was ten and I no doubt deserved it, being thrown out into the streets in my own vomit and someone else's piss. ‘And what are you going to do about it kid?’ - And that was when I met Alaris.\"\n\n\"Alaris was a ranger who worked along the front lines of the Dead Scar and that night had taken to the tavern to sate his addiction - i’m talking a more primal addiction that starts in the loins and finishes in a glass of milk. If you don’t know what I’m talking about then this story is going to get a lot less child friendly. It was actually his own bought consort he was supposed to be with that was crying her eyes out and ran into the tavern, becoming wet in all the wrong places, primarily her eyes. So in a sense, we both had had a pretty shit night. Alaris explained to me that if I wanted to see change happen, then I would have to start learning how to make a difference, and that started with learning to fight.\"\n\n\"The next part is pretty dull, I learned to fight, I learned humility and I also became a father - figuratively, to my Dragonhawk. I did get word from Baesh in time, but this happened after the Prince Kael’thas had publically become known as a traitor and Lor’themar stepped up as Regent Lord. A soldier that served out there actually gave the letter to me and explained it would have been sent off a lot sooner, but it came from Northrend. It turned out Baesh was in the suicidal fight against Arthas in the North, the one where the Sin’dorei tried to find vengeance but only found more death. So it was confirmed, Baesh had died.\"\n\n\n\"The Sin’dorei were as a race re-building and finding a new standing point, we had been guided to joining the Horde and as I said. Death happens, but life doesn’t stop to say ‘Oh dear, poor thing’. It keeps going and so must we. But what got me moving was the re-appearance of an old friend. That Dragonhawk I had let go, that’s right, Baesh’s, returned to Eversong - and we stumbled to each other upon the hilltops near the ocean. It took me a while to realise why this Dragonhawk was acting so strangely, but it was unmistakably his. I ran home - or to what had become home, a small collective group of houses that had been rebuilt on the trolls old land and become inhabited by Alaris and some other friends we’d made together.\"|r",

Very little else can be noticed upon his person in the way of valuables with the exception of his gilded cufflinks, a signet ring and a coin purse.\n\nIn battle, Ior'dal would be seen in a harness of full plate, clad over additional layers of mail and cloth padding. It is utilitarian in form and offers little in the way of decorative touches beyond the ebon/claret colours that identify those of his order. These items are the products of experienced artisans and would be regarded as a prized possession.\n\n\n\n",

Mostly hidden. Around each of her lower thighs she has what appears to be a leather belt that is strapped around with a small flat pouch on each, these contains each five small thorwing-daggers. On her upper thighs she has two black holsters strapped around her thighs that each contains a dagger, this does that the handle of the dagger is pointed upwards. In her gloves she has a simple metal piece built in underneath the surface which bends after her hand, preventing her to straighten her hand completely.\n\nNemyt's waistline goes in, making her have a natural hour-glass shaped silhouette that compliments her feminine looks, this however looking more hour-glass shaped due to the fact that she has quite the broad hips, and a flat stomach which may make her hip bones and her rib cage stick slightly out. Her breasts are seen pretty much within the avarage size of any typical Sin'dorei and leads down to get flat and slender stomach, clearly taking care of keeping her weight. Nemyt has  scars everywhere on her body. Her whole back is covered by long scars made by a whip and quite small scars on her arms made by blades which hit her in many battles.\n\nHer face is of a thin posture, while her chin ends up in a slight point. Her nose bridge is small as her nose tip is pointing forward. Nemyt's eyes emit a shadow violet color due to her class, however not so strong and rather pale. She has completely white hair, straight and loose hair that leads down to her chest. Her lips are small, but slightly thick. Nemyt has a long slender neck that would make her collar- bones show easily, and thus also having somewhat small and fragile shoulders.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:a8343b}Personality and Traits{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:692428}Bubbly, energetic and charming. Nemyt often hides her demented mind behind a childish exterior, which she can combine with the flirtatious demeanor of a woman who is aware of her good looks and will use them to get what she wants. She is also much more intelligent than she lets on, often causing friend or foe alike to underestimate her. In addition to being a skilled manipulator, she's prone to explosive fits of rage and has a violent streak. Most of Nemyt's incarnations do possess a softer side and are capable of genuinely caring about others, however. Nemyt can also be very loyal to people she cares about, but at the same time she struggles with an innate selfishness and a sense of dependence on others.{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{h1:c}{col:a8343b}History{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:692428}Nemyt Stormlight, born in Dalaran by two loving parents and with her older brother. Her parents died when she was just 12, which is considered a child among the Blood Elves. After that she and her brother moved to Eversong Woods, closer to the more populated places in the Sin'dorei community. Her brother raised her for a big part of her light, but she was never taught how to defend herself or how to use any sort of magic, which made her an easy target for different assassins, bandits, thugs, rogues, and so on... And after 8 years she finally fell prey  to Amani Troll, during the Second War. He wasn't planning to kill her straight away, he tortured her, used violence and injured her in all different ways, until someone broke into the den of this troll and killed him with quite a fight. The rogue revealed his face, and it was not Kaledon - Nemyt's brother... It was an unknown person she barely could see, her vision was blurry and she ended up by just closing her eyes and falling asleep. She woke up in a house, definitely cozier than the troll's hiding place. That rogue taught her his ways - How to apply poison, how to fight, the ways of stealth and immediate liquidation of one's foes... \nUnfortunately\nfor one rogue, there is another one. Her savior was brutally murdered by another rogue that right after, ran away, leaving enough traces for her to be able to find him shortly after, in the desire for vengeance, in range and in fury...\nWhen she arrived there, she saw who that murderer was - her own brother .She wasn't able to kill or even hurt him. Although he was capable of things, even worse than what the troll did. He slashed her skin with burning blades, knocked her out... Until one day, she used her skills to break free, and in a one on one duel she had beaten him. She killed him, stabbing right through his chest, through his heart. She would not have a better reason to kill him than the truth he has revealed, the painful truth - He was the one that killed her family... \nAfter that she stayed in Silvermoon city for some years until the Scourge attacked the city and killed most of the population. Nemyt luckily survived but it was a rough battle. Since then, she never stayed too long at one same place, she lived basing on stealing, robbing and selling. During the Third War she hid in Stranglethorn. She had quite the reputation on the Gurubashi arena and after a while she left, traveling on her own across the world. Nemyt has faced many threats, but with each one she became more experienced and destroyed each threat with her battle-scarred daggers and her unbelievable agility...{/col}{/p}\n\n",

Graceful steps have carried the raven topped Mist Weaver through many trials and tribulations during her short life, though she keeps her past close to her chest. Like an oysters shell Hali's heart is hard to pry open, yet to endeavour is to reap the glistening bounty of a perfect pearl.\n\nShe turns her attention to you then, a silken brow raised in silent question. Her face is heart shaped and as beautiful as the rest of her kin though slightly rounder than most, missing the angular cheekbones. A softly bowed pair of lips bloom into a confident smile, though her gaze is guarded. When they part a voice as sweet and smooth as honey butter meets your ears, her tongue very often running away from her and opinions rarely reserved. \n\nWith a shrug she moves a slender hand to reajust the fabric of her tunic, a habitual motion which draws your attention to her graceful curves though that is not her intent. Her waist is slender, small enough for hands to wrap around entirely. In contrast hips and bust are more shapely than she would like, the hourglass of her figure not something particularly common in Elven females and certainly something she longs to be rid of but can never seem to change.\nHer free hand moves to sweep the loose curls and waves of her hair away from sea foam eyes, the tresses falling to her shoulders like pitch water. That gaze is dazzling and inquisitive, the only makeup discernable being a sweep of mascara which draws your attention inevitabley to the velvet fan of her lashes. A few moments more and she makes her excuses, turning to leave the way she came in a lingering cloud of coconut shampoo which seems to veil the faint scent of salt water.{/col}\n\n{h3:c}{col:515874}--Tattoos--{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775902043436482602/779019604453490708/20201119_162019.jpg*Left Arm}{/p} {p:c}{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775902043436482602/779022789973114950/20201119_163406.jpg*Spine}{/p} {p:c}{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733715166906286114/779022947016245308/20201119_162003.jpg*Below Breasts}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Rain:512:2}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-9:64:64}\n{h3:c}{col:515874}--The Water Baby--{/col}{/h3}\n{col:8f5983}Toes wriggle in the sand, then dash away from the playful wave which seeks to lap at them. Laughter chimes across the beach, as sweet and smooth as honey butter as she flops back to sit just shy of the pursuing tide. \nEbony curls catch the setting suns rays, kissing her shoulders like inky glass. \n\nShe has always loved the sea, chasing it's waves since she was a young child and taking any oppertunity to swim in its cool embrace. Today is no different and she rises to her feet in a fluid movement, gracefully slipping out of her clothing and allowing it to pool upon the sand at her feet. In a mere moment she dives beneath the waves, swimming in long, strong strokes until her slender arms ache. Only then does she burst forth from below the surface to inhale a salty breath of air. As sun sets she leaves the beach, her heart as always lingering in the waters.{/col}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:515874}--Guild--{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/250160?*Crazy Eight's AA Page}{/p}\n{p:c}{link*https://www.argentarchives.org/node/250152*Hali's AA Page}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Rain:512:2}\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-9:64:64}\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-ThunderPinnacle:256:128}",

His shoulders and upper arms especially seem better trained and developed than the rest of his sleek and lithe shape, an educated guess would suggest the bow he carries on his back responsible for this.\n\nHis weapon appears a typical elven design, artisan and gilded but no less practical to use. Rich magics flow through the supple wood it was carved from.\nThe rest of his attire would suggest something along the lines of a ranger or scout, leather and light chain - at times scuffed or torn by wear and tear outdoors but still well presented, casual and humble in style. On his belt he carries a manner of assorted outdoorsman tools and a knife.\n\nHis age seems difficult to place, while by no means showing the gravity of time passing on his features, an oft-held gaze of weariness may suggest more than just overt cynicism. By no means a picture of exceptional aesthetics, quite the opposite, a rather rustic and comely look to him, accentuated with his tidy beard.\n\nNevertheless he still has lustre in his hair and skin, his eyes a gentle, almost subdued green to them. He is marked with a few old wounds, but nothing fresh. The most recent being a particularly deep gash on his forehead. Atop his head his short hair is let to grow largely in any undirected fashion, girdled only by a headband to stop it overtaking his vision.\n\nHe has a dry voice, strung through forced elocution over many years.

He was a legen among his clan - The burning blade - being on the advisors the the chieftain. He has few sibling which se scarecely talks about, and also had a wife and dozen children. His wife died before the Orcs journey onto Azeroth, and his children now roam the world as adventurers and legends in their own right. Not long after the Orcish invasion, due to a certain incident Koruz went into Exile, becoming a hermit wandering about Azeroth, which is also the reason for his near nonexistant fel taint. However, after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits and their attempts to reform the Horde, he made his way back to his former comrades, hoping to forge his honor anew, and make up for the sins of his past.\n\n{h2:c}Current events{/h2} {icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nThese days Koruz is part of the inner circle of Darkheart company, serving as it's secondary leader. Unfortunately at the end of the last campaign while attempting to save his comrades he was gunned down by a rogue ethereal, resulting in his arrival to the Shadowlands. After some time journeying and battling through Shadowlands, he managed to find a gateway that allowed him to return from the land of the damned, but not without a cost. He now appears just like he always did, a normal orc, his being is forever changed.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2} {icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is considered an elder among his kin, living for quite a long time, he gathered scars and marks across his body. However for an orc his age he is still strong and of good physique, making many wonder how mighty he was in his younger years. Even now not many orc can match his strenght, and fewer can match his skill with the blade. The only thing that truly betrays him to his true age is his hair, as it's unmistakingly silver color stands quite out.\n",

Taking advantage of the chaos Trade Prince Gallywix has the rest of the population enslaved nd any wealth they had stolen when they arrive on the Lost Isles. There while forced to mine Kaja'mite Wulu starting hearing things. Fearing she was going mad she kept quiet about these voices. Luckily she didnt have to wait long, as Thrall and his Horde aided the freed goblins to save the others. There she was finally freed and sent to the Orgrimmar orphanage where she stayed for a few months haunted by the voices.\n\nOne day she wandered from the orphanage to deal with the voices only to find herself going mad starting repeat the words she heard. Before things got out of hand a Troll warlock sensing a summoning in progress outside safe circles comes to her aide. With a fast cast of subjugate demon he caught the imp that tormented her and seeing potential he took her under his wing to learn control over the demons. She was his student for only a month before he lost his life to a twilight cult invasion attempt.\n\nWhile still very young and in a state grief she sought to leave orgrimmar and sneaks on an emissary ship. She sneaks on with little trouble being smaller than a gnome at the time. Upon arriving she flees the boat when its attacked by some zandalari that at the time were working on invasion plans to pandaria. Lost in zuldazar streets she wandered the streets and surrounding foliage picking plants that looked even the slightest bit valuable developing a talent for identifing high quality herbs. A zandalari troll alchemist took notice of this talent and officially adopted her though, she'd call him mentor instead of father something he encouraged since it would keep them both safe for the time. From then on she was raised as a zandalari was taught about the loa and alchemy so to have a trade of her own.\n \nOne time while fishing she caught a fish that was too big and it pulled her into the water where she was swallowed whole. In the belly of the serpent like fish Bwonsamdi appeared in a fit of laughter at her ironic death though due to good laugh was willing to let her live since the fish was guilty of eating a former priest of his. Inspired and terrified Wulu bargained with bwonsambi when she nearly met her death again at the hands of a blood troll defiling Bwonsamdi's temple and becoming a new priestess, the first zandalari goblin priestess of graves. From then on shes protected and cared for the temple only leaving to collect souls or potion ingredients. A few years after reaching adulthood orgrimmar makes contact again making peace this time, from there she visits orgrimmar making friends with races that werent there before and with that her old fears began to dwindle.\n",

Though her eyes are covered by a sash she carries a 'cute' button nose and a pair of thin lips which are usually always curved upwards into some form of devious smile. Her skin slightly pinkish, but predominantly pale.\n\nHer attire was fairly standard for an Illidari.

Came to Azeroth along with other orcs back during First war. Because of a certain incident, before Orgrim Doomhammer's rise to power, he fled the Horde to live as a Hermit travelling across Azeroth. Rejoined the Horde during the founding of Orgrimmar after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits.\n\nConsidered more gentle and cosiderate than most orcs, Still values Honor and strenght. His wolf is always somewhere nearby.\nWidower with sons all over the place.\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nKoruz became part of the leadership of Darkheart company. Nearing the end of the last campaign he died attempting to save his friends. Recently came back after journeying through Shadowlands.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2}{icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is an Older orc, a fact that isnt reflected in his appearance, betrayed only by the silver color of his hair. said hair is lenghty, tied into various braids, and a ponytail to ensure it won't be a problem in combat. his beard is also quite long, and braided aswell. His physique is quite impressive on it's own, even for an orc, without even mentioning his age, leaving the wonder of how he looked when he was younger. various scars adorn his body, left by anything starting from beasts, through enemy warriors, and otherwordly creatures. his body is also adorned in tatoo's, which on first glance look like typical Burning blade marks, but in fact serve as runes, that are able to protect Koruz from harmfull magical effects of magics, with void and light magic remaining exception, which although still slightly protected from, remains quite vulnerable to. his expressions tend to be a bit dimmed down, remaining mostly calm in all situations.\n\n{h2:c}Equipment{/h2}{icon:spell_warrior_sharpenblade:25}\n\nKoruz's equipment is mostly simply, resembling a typical blademaster's attire. fine quality leather gloves with bronze vembraces, long kilt woven from strong thread with few steel plates attached, and a double belt with sacks attached to hold it up. Padded leather belts crossing on his chest and tied around his biceps for a bit of extra protection, but mainly because of the pouches on said belts for exttra carry space. otherwise he wears no chestplate as to not limit his movements, spare cloth bandages covering parts of his chest and arms, for unknown reasons. His boots are also made from strong leather, with steel tips and few spikes. His most prized possesion is his blade, that to many remains mystery. Most often his blade look quite simplistic, it's long and slick, but still tough and sturdy. It widens at the end with a ring being attached at the end containing various trophies and trinkets. what is unusual about it is it's blue glow, and slightly colder and spiritual aura.\nAfter coming back from his unfortunate journey through shadowlands, his blade now shifts between that and the other apperance. That other appearance looks like a runeblade, similarly built to the other one, with it's tip resembling a guillotine. adorned with various runes, and a skull with dark steel plates. the blade emanates a sickly green aura that seeps around like a miasma. Those who look upon that blade tend to feel unnatural fear, and those of stronger spirit feel discomfort.\n",

He was adopted and raised by High Elder Cloudfall, the head of the monastery, but his time in the monastery as the only vulpera was rough. Peers didn’t take him seriously and the elders just ogled him which made him the vulpera he is now. Rather shy, inconspicuous and lacking courage. However, it didn’t stop him from helping those in need, listening to those who need an open ear or obeying his father for monastery needs. The little vulperas interests were simple, finding a way to get better in those things, by challenging himself and learning first aid. \n\nDays past, Haru learned, obeyed and got disciplined in the way the monastery educates their orphans, but the peace got interrupted as the Burning Legion attacked the Peak of Serenity. Haru, someone with now greater knowledge in first aid was called to work in the field hospitals close to the invasion. Those endless days of pain, suffering and exhaustion changed him and his believes as one pandaren girl died in his paws in the middle of the treatment. It was his first encounter with death, an endless state with no return. Guilt embraced the little fox and he promised himself to get better, to find a way that this won’t happen again. He devoted his life to the Light.\n\nThrough books, wandering priests and believer of the Light, Haru managed to feel and use the Light for his purposes.\n\nAs a friar of the monastery, Haru leads tours, guides the travelers around and takes care of getting ingredients for monastery purposes as well as the brewery. Besides his work in the monastery, he travels to gain new knowledge, meet new friends, help those in need and make important experiences in life.\n\n\n{h2:c}{icon:inv_misc_book_13:25} Spells {icon:inv_misc_book_13:25}{/h2}\n\n{icon:paladin_holy:25}Light's Blessing\n(your character feels a pleasant warmth for the duration of one hour)\n\n{icon:spell_nature_slow:25}Chains of Faith\n(shakles your character, high chance to miss, short duration, long preparation time, your character can attempt to break it)\n\n{icon:spell_holy_heal:25}Minor and Major Healing\n(can heal minor injuries or support the healing process of more threatening injuries)\n\n\n{h2:c}{icon:inv_first_aid_70_medicalkit:25} Medical Box {icon:inv_first_aid_70_medicalkit:25}{/h2}\n{icon:ability_mage_conjurefoodrank12:25}Disinfectant crystal water (1/2 left)\n{icon:inv_misc_bandage_18:25}Bandages\n{icon:inv_firstaid_healingsalve2:25}Pain relieving ointment (1/2 left)\n{icon:inv_misc_herb_liferoot_stem:25}One branch of Liferoot in a draenic pouch",

Her long, ashen blonde hair is often let loose to drape over her shoulders and back, and just as her skin, is always well taken care of and presentable. \n\nZynarah often wears some form of jewellery, mostly silver, sometimes copper, with either amethysts or emeralds, but the most notable item she seems to, without fail, carry with her everywhere she goes, is her magical catalyst. A wicked looking dagger, brimming with fel and shadow energies, is a blade made of some unknown steel-like material with dark purple runes dotted across its surface and a crossguard shaped in the form of demonic wings. Its curved blade is, despite the original purpose serving more the function of a wand, is still extremely sharp, with its back edge adorned by serrations. While the handle looks uncomfortable to hold for an onlooker, whenever it sits in Zynarah's grip, it seems as though it was specifically made for her palm. Finally, its pommel is made up of a hook, looking somewhat sharp from a distance, but is, in reality completely blunt and safe to hold or grab on to. \n\nZynarah's form is, while fit and can be easily found attractive, does not seem to have a lot of strength to it. If one was to observe her, it'd be easy enough to tell that, while she's well built for prolongued periods of time spent physically active, she's definitely not a warrior. \nMoreover, her womanly features are shapely and well pronounced, in which she holds not a small measure of pride, made clear by most of her attires boldly, but not indecently, calling attention to the beauties of her form. \nAll this, however is contrasted by the sight that would greet anyone who would look down at her right hand. They would spot a mangled, blackened, all but skeletal appendage, with fingers ending in hideous, claw-like fingers. Small cracks with fel shining through them would also be dotted around whatever is left of the skin of the hand, leaving an altogether gruesome sight. ",

Long raven black hair bundled up messy at the back of his head with errant strands of hair remaining untamed and draped over his shoulders. \n\nA light shadow of unshaven beard on his sharp jawline, a sharp nose, clawlike scars over his nose reaching his cheek. Bags under his eyes from a lack of sleep and/or substance abuse. Krethol like most of his kin, doesn’t seem to care much about his appearance. A rugged look, even reflected in his attire. Dark clothing and patched up leather parts holding everything together. He stands somewhat tall amongst his kin, yet not noticeably so.\n\nHis physique is lean with well defined musculature. Usually he’s seen with his trusted bow strapped to his back. On his lips a small smirk is often present. This male doesn’t seem rather careless, yet his yellow/green eyes seem watchful and alert. Krethol gives off an untrustworthy aura, and from readily apparent evidence he may in fact not be. Always seems up to something.",

Even the house matron, Nathlaeril, has fallen in the fight against the Lich King and turned into a San'layn.\n\nBorn along with her twin brother, Xalerian, Elysia shared in the education he did, which means a lot of training in the magical arts. Both of the children have sacrificed their youth in order to become deadly weapons of their people. Besides magic, Xalerian was educated in the arts of diplomacy and money-making so he may one day become the head of the Dawnstar family, Elysia was trained in the arts of shadow, subterfuge and assassination, so that she may carefully remove and enemies of her family and her people.\n\nRight before the assassinations started against our family, Elysia has taken her newly-born daughter ( Still searching for an IC father. ), Leadrel and given her to the Blood Knights for training and security, so that she may escape the killers. The young member of the family shares the magic talents of her parents, combined with the training of the Blood Knights and a passion for the arts.\n\nWhere we stand now: Nathlaeril has broken from the chains of the Lich King and is now free-wiiled, Xalerian has remained in the public domain, attempting to restore the glory of his house, while Elysia went off the grid in a fit of rage and desire for vengeance, finding all sorts of activities to keep her occupied: from painting and travelling to being a hired killer. Laedrel is travelling across Azeroth, writing, singing, trying to help people and speaking to the ghosts of the past.\n\nIn their own ways, the members of the Dawnstar family are working towards the same goal, albeit in very different approaches: restoring their family ( which, if you are interested, welcomes your Sin'dorei character! ) to their rightful place.",

His hair is short and styled, and he sports a small chin strap beard that stretches around his lower jaw. His eyes are the colour of jade, indicating at Kelsyth continues to parktake in Fel magics to sustain him as apposed to the power of the rejuventated Sunwell.

This is a result of his time among the Farstriders where methodical planning  and observational skills were common traits that were required to succeed in the field.\nHe prefers to work with individuals with calm demeaners and even cooler heads. He has little time for rash individuals, viewing emotional outbursts  as \"sloppy behaviour\" that could result in a botched contract.\n\nDespite his professionalism, Kelsyth is not above having fun or relaxing, in fact, he is known for his sharp sense of humour and dry wit - if not at times sarcastic. He enjoys strolls through the cities and a glass of whiskey at the local tavern. He is also very much fashion-conscious, preferring to dress himself smartly and practically while on or off a job.",

The rest of her fur is milky white in colour with little tints of caramel brown flexed into it.\n\nIshii's eyes are a deep shade of Jade green. Her hair is a rich shade of caramel brown with two long streaks of bright vibrant pink hair running through it.\n\nThe pink locks of hair are worn in loving honour & respect of her twin sister Nimosa who now lives among the Races of the Alliance.\n\nThe fur around Ishii's neck clearly stands out from the rest of her soft well kept fur. It is heavily matted & scurffy looking.\n\nHaving suffered a near fatal injury as a Cub the skin under her fur around her neck is heavily scarred & burnt. Although Ishii survived the attack the injury has left her Mute.\n\nIshii is a Master Illusionist & Pyromancer. Ishii has come up with a unique way of communication. Ishii uses her magical talents to create visions & images to hopefully get her point or feelings across to those she meets.\n\nIshii is also highly skilled & fluent in communicating via Sign Language. A skill that she has taught to several of her friends, family & loved ones.\n\nIshii's left ear can often be seen twitching & wiggling softly by itself when she is clearly in a good mood or feeling happy. This behaviour changes to her right ear when she is feeling down, frightened or sad.\n\nIf being in extreme hot or cold temperatures or conditions bothers Ishii it would not show. As she always seems comfortable & composed in both.\n\nIshii's tail is very rarely still for very long, It can normally be seen wiggling happily behind her especially at the sight, mention or thought of Spot or her Family.\n\n*Out Like a Light!*\nIshii has a very unconventional & rather odd way of sleeping. When sleepy or in need of a nap Ishii will pick a spot & curl up like  a cat or dog would possibly do.\n\nIshii often uses her thick busy tail to shield her eyes and face while she sleeps. Ishii will literally sleep through almost anyhting!\n\nIshii is a skilled Blade Mistress, she favours the use of a single blade weapon in combat. Ishii's Shakatani Warblade is honed to a keen & deadly finish.\n\nWhat Ishii may lack in physical strength in combat compaired to some of her opponents she more than makes up for in speed & skill.\n\nIn combat Ishii relise on the speed, skill, agility & ferocity of her deadly lightning fast attacks to overcome her opponents. Her movments are swift & graceful as she performs her deadly dance.\n\n*The Whispers Edge*\nWhen drawn the magnificent blade humm's softly with a deep latent power embedded in the heart of its steel. The blade of Whispers Edge is envelloped in a powerful Arcane Aura that keeps the blade eternally keen & razor sharp allowing a well placed strike to cut deep through flesh & armour alike.\n\nIn combat Ishii will often magically ignite the blade of Whispers Edge fully enhancing its already deadly & destructive capablities.\n\n*Flame Heart Tattoo*\nIshii has a Magical Tattoo on her left wrist, it is clearly visable  at all times through her fur. The tattoo is a purple flaming heart, it glows softly.\n\nThe twined tattoo to this one sits on the wrist of Ishii's twin sister Nimosa.",

Of the marks on his hide, one in particular stands out from the rest: A pale patch of skin as if it was still coldburned, in middle of his chest. The orcs tusks are sturdy in appearance and in some ways seem as if they were being used often. Tips of his fingers all end to a bony claws, rather than usual nails.\nFor an orc he's pretty hairy too.\nUsualy clad in an ancient suit of reinforced scalemail, totemic runes carved on the reinforcing plates, plates, those also in many places like rest of the armor, show signs of repairs and damage in battle, bringing the armor a rugged, time toughened appearance matching to its wearer.\nThe orc stands with straight back. Hunching is for peons and warsongs ( And 'orks'.)\n\nArmor effects: In addition of doing what armor does: which is keeping cuts from getting through. \n\nthere also are enchanted sigils projecting defences against certain types of magical attacks. \n4x sigils of necromancer's bane : greatly diminish effects of unholy and otherwise necrotic sources of damage. (2 added during initial campaing in plaguelands. 2 more added during war against the lich king in northrend. )\n4x sigils of demon's bane: Greatly diminish effects of fel-based incoming spelldamage. (added during expedition to outlands. )\n\nNever is the shaman seen without his wolfmask. Mane of the mask descends down to his back and shoulders as a short cape. While the eyes are covered by lenses, with bright fiery light glowing through them. Some have claimed this to give him something of an intimidating appearance of some half-wolven creature.\nAt times the wolf mask can be seen equiped with an armoured plating over it, matching with rest of the orcs armor.\n\nMask Effect: Shielded eyes = Immune to blinding powders, gasses and bright flashes..and sand naturaly doesnt get in them either. \n\nSometimes uses a scarf to cover his lower face aswell. \n\nOver the armor normaly is worn a badly torn, many times repaired old tabard of by now dull  colour, its markings barely noticeable by now.\n\nTo complete the kit, he normaly has an utility belt of some description also worn, along with equipment harness, with compact backpack secured on its backside, pouches on front side orderly filled with different items of possible use.\nOh and there is row of grenades too. (Applies only when chest armour is worn )\n\nOn his back can at all times seen chained his iconic, spiky maul, serving purpose of both weapon and totem at the same time, and having served the orc through countless of battlefields.\nUsualy seen with shield strapped on the backpack too.\nAged knife can be seen hanging by backside of his belt too. \nRight next to an ornamental pistol of some form. \n\nIf carrying an great axe, it is usualy held in right hand and rested against shoulderguard on the same side. \n\nOther items of notice: \n-Armored tome hangs normaly on his left side. \n-Reinforced satchel usualy seen hanging on his right side.\n-bag with odd hook holstered on its side, chain leading inside the back usualy somewhere on his belt.\n-Remains of his old Northrend era Kor'kron guard tabard hang on the left side of his belt.\n-Badge of Mok'lohn command marauder Blood Guard is usually clipped somewhere on his belt..it is worthless, really. Just like the kor'kron tabard remains and badge of 41.st legion blood guard. But a memory of old days anyway. \n-Pair of reinforced flasks hang by his belt. other one is colour of red, and other of blue. both dented and scratched..but still intact.\nTrophies! : small items attached there and there on his pouches. Trophies taken from most memorable battlefields on his career, ranging as far back as to days before Frostwolves broke through dark portal for the first time.\n\n\nA raven can at times be spotted sitting on the orcs shoulderguard.\n\nUnlike most of the common grunts and less experienced orcs usually: He washes fairly often and in general maintains personal cleanlines. \n\n2)\nThat of a massive wolf, its fur either light grey or pitch black. Occasionaly red-ish. \n\non rare occasion makes use of spectral wolf's form, instead of going through full physical transformation.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Commonly known history:\n\nThe orc is known to have been around during first war, during which he claimed lives if humans and orcs in equal measure, for what he claims to have been a common flaw among them: Weakness of will.\nWasnt seen since then until third war when he joined the other orcs for the exodus to Kalimdor.\n\nThe most recent career of the orcish veteran can be tracked to warfronts such as:\n-Battle for Mt.Hyjal\n-Opening of gates of Ahn'Qiraj\n-Wrathgate\n-Wintergrasp\n-Battles against rampaging elementals during beginning of cataclysm\n-Tol barad\n-Isle of thunder offensive\n-Ashran\n-Broken shore\n-Various smaller warfronts around Azeroth, including kul tiras and zuldazar..and the rest of so called 'fourth war'. \n-Transfered to unknown duties /position for the Duration of the 'peace' that arrived post 4.th war. \n\n..Oh yeah. From time to time he teaches new shamans to their trade too.\n\n((Say no to growth potions. Learn to write and read descriptions. ))\n\n\n\n122-370,8",

As she walks amongst the white-faced Sin'dorei with their rose coloured cheeks and academic books held to their chests, she does not blend in as one would expect her to.\n\nNo, certainly as you watch her movements, you notice that she walks with the gait of a wind-up toy, as though expecting at any moment for the sky to fall from the heavens or for the ground to open up beneath her feet. Each step gently, purposefully placed with swift transitions to get from each point hastily, she gives the impression of a puzzle piece that doesn't fit the mould.\n\nCuriously when standing still, Rowynwen with her back pressed to solid walls, wears the expression of a caged bird, looking around for a place she can take flight. Small in height and with skin like a freshly bloomed peacebloom, it is easy to be led to feel as though she is a fragile song bird that would be happier seen in the world outside of the confines of society. \n\nHer eyes as bright as christmas lights, glitter a fresh green hue like an uncut emerald stone, framed by thick deep orange lashes. They move with the transition of someones focus sweeping back and forth like a pendulum over the surrounding area, in-taking the world and its details slowly. \n\nBeneath her almost almond shaped eyes, following the softest of curves that make up a petite nose and sat above a soft jaw is painted red lips. Often seen nestled into a nervous almost shy line that wavers from a polite, friendly smile to a deepened pout, she gives off a rather friendly portait in features.\n\nSoft, diluted ginger tones sprout from the crown of her head in the form of silken spun hair, tied glossily into a high pony-tail. Her fringe is kept free form, shorter than the rest of her hair, falling just above her freckle dusted cheeks and often swept to one side over her left eye. \n\nHer voice sounds soft with careful pronunciations in Orcish that can quite easily be perceived as text-book taught, finding the language harsher to cope with. The harder vowels and tones coming away dulled and gentle. In her native tongue she sounds more sure of herself with a wary tone. \n\nHer armour always seems to be too outlandish to be from her homeland and she rarely can be seen wearing reds and golds, favouring browns and greens that blend her into forests and grassland. On her left arm she wears an armlet composed of reddish brown strands of metal that coil around themselves in a vine-like pattern. Several metallic leaves rest against her skin - covering a certain grey blemish - and become accentuated by the slightest hint of tiny pear-shaped gemstones bearing a dull mixture of green and blue hues. It is a usual assumption after clocking eyes on Rowynwen, that she is indeed, not a usual Sin'dorei.\n\nRowyn most recently has acquired a mercy blade made from damascus steel in a dull grey colour with a bronze hilt of a Dragonhawk - the hilt specifically being a tail. It is sharp and well cared for in an ebon hilt with a silver chain keeping it lodged to her belt at all times.|r\n\n{img:Interface\\DRESSUPFRAME\\DressingRoomDruid:512:512}",

Every fight she's had bolstered her body into a mass of unpronounced but very well-placed muscle, giving her the shape of a strong athlete. Entirely necessary to survive, considering the many scars that litter her skin and the irregular fur on her arms, legs and torso that show it. She still has that pure black fur, though stained it with the marks of the Grimtotem and other tauren tribes to show her allegiance. They include Bloodhoof, Skychaser and Runetotem markings.\n\nHer mane is a striking feature. It is big, fluffy and hangs over her shoulders, but even more along her back. The hair droops down over her eyes to conceal them, giving her a very unkempt and shy look. The two braids that dangle down her front are more expressive. They are incredibly lengthy, nearly reaching the ground and sway with every step she makes. Her tail descends along with them, reaching the ground too and often swinging along with her moves.\n\nHer figure leaves nothing to be desired. A highly feminine bend of her spine nudges her torso slightly forwards and pronounces her heavy chest. Her massive thighs break all the world records. She must put very serious effort into maintaining her endurance, and the long legs she carries forward on powerful hooves make her look like a kodo about to stampede. Her black horns leave the exact same impression because they point directly forwards like those of a rampaging bull. Their length is great, allowing her to impale her enemies. In a fight she will topple most foes with a lengthy charge while running at a speed that is very high above the average. Frighteningly, she maintains that speed in plate armour.\n\nShe regularly carries around trophies of battles she has survived, and sometimes she brings along a scroll case for improvised rune-scribing. Whenever she has her weapons around they tend to be quite bulky, but the runes she put on them give them the power she needs to use them well.\n\nOverall she is a Grimtotem that should rightfully be feared when she stands against you.\n\n",

Knowing both the combat styles of a Thalassian Farstrider and Lordaeronian knight has made him into a powerful fighter.\n\nWhen the Dark Portal opened, his mother had decided to return to Quel'thalas, but he remained in Lordaeron, considering himself a coward if he fled before the invaders.\n\nDuring the Second War, he fought for Lordaeron against the Old Horde. During the Horde's assault on Quel'thalas, his mother had lost her life at the hands of the Amani Trolls. He had grew to hate the Amani and all that side with them ever since.\n\nDespite the eventual downfall of the Amani and the Alliance's triumph over the Horde, the pain of losing his only family was the one he could never overcome.\n\nHe remained loyal to Lordaeron and served in the army all the way until Prince Arthas Menethil betrayed his kingdom and brought the Scourge to destroy them. Once Lordaeron fell, he went to Dalaran, where he joined Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider's forces, fighting for reclamation of Quel'thalas.\n\n In slaying Amani and the Scourge of Quel'thalas, he had seen himself somewhat redeem himself for not being present when his mother lost her life.\n\nHe remained fighting for Silvermoon under the lead of Lor'themar Theron ever since, fighting against anyone who would oppose it.

But the big question was how would I get one? Too big to steal and a bit too complex for me to make on my own. Turns out, I got one in a very unusual way!\n\nI was exploring the waters in Azshara, a fair distance from Bilgewater Harbor, when I spotted something laying deep in the water. It was heavily burnt and very rusty, but from the shape and size it was some kinda Mech. Finders keepers as the saying goes! This thing was gonna be mine. With the help of a druid friend and my mechanical scorpion we managed to pull the burnt wreck to shore. I pulled off all sorts of grime, gunk and crap from the remains and I could get a clear look at what exactly I have found. It was a Goblin Mech that was for sure, the design was a bit different from others though, yes it was missing the majority of its plating and was very rusty but something about it seemed different. \n\nI got to work looking over every inch of the Mech and towards the rear of the frame I spotted a serial number which read “XX00”, very unusual I thought to myself. From what I remember of serial numbers and mass production, serial numbers of XX00 usually are assigned to prototypes…could this be the prototype to all Goblin Mechs? Upon further inspection of the Mech I could see the majority of its wiring and gears were intact, if a little rusty, so this thing could be repaired…it would just take a lot of time.\n\nI dragged my Mech to an area of Azshara I know no one goes to and hid it under a few rocks. I compiled a list of everything I would need to repair it. It needed new plating which meant I would need a lot of metal, the gears and wiring need cleaning and testing, it would need a new core…oh and finally a fresh coat of paint. \n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-horde-TransformAzermek:256:128}\n{h2:c}Restoration and Reconstruction{/h2}\n\n{h3}Week 1{/h3}\nI decided to try my best to get the Mech moving, as I think it would be fairly simple to do with a temporary power core. I erm...” acquired” a power core that was used to power…well honestly, I don’t know, I just found it in a pile of junk! I cleaned up the gears and wiring as best as I could and connected the power core, pressed the ignition button and ran to hide (ya know just in case the thing went boom!). I peeked from behind a rock and saw the Mech didn’t explode! It was standing there in all its rusty glory. I hopped in the frame, where I had assembled a very crude and simple cockpit, and tested to see if it could move. Success! It could move and with some speed…yea sure it was very noisy as it still had a lot of rust that needed removing, but who cares for now!\n\n{h3}Week 2{/h3}\nWell, seems the Mech was in worse shape than I thought! Every 4th step the right leg would seize up and become very hard to move. I decided what the heck, might as well strip the legs down to their basic parts and take a looksie at what’s going on. Inside the legs I saw the gears were slightly bent out of shape causing them to grind and stick, fixing the gears would be a pain…maybe I could steal…I mean…”find” some new ones! I summoned my robot pal Blaster and asked him to scan each gear “beep boop beep” he said, which I assume meant yes. With the gears scanned it was time to hunt down suitable replacements, first stop was Gnomeregan. \n\nOk, what the hell! Lazy ass Gnomes, their home is still a freakin’ mess! Scratch that then, I did hear someone talk about a “Junk Heap” in Tiragarde and getting there would be easy. I hoped on a Horde boat that was heading to Kul Tiras and luck would have it they were stopping off at Tiragarde. “Captain I am on orders from Gallywix himself to secure materials to help the war effort!” that’s the lie I told the Captain, and it worked like a charm! I suppose the fact I was boarding the ship with 3 mechanical creations (Kay Nine, Blaster and Scorpinator) might have made the Captain think I must be super important!\n\nAs soon as we made port and hopped on Scorpinator and made my way to the “Junk Heap”. Oh boy! When I arrived, I was in heaven. Junk? Who the hell calls all this Junk!? It’s treasure! Everywhere I looked, gears, cogs, scraps of metal…everything an Engineer could need! Blaster got to work scanning the area and finding suitable gears, while I chilled and played with Kay Nine and Bandit. Eventually we had a complete set of gears and some spares, I loaded them onto a box I had attached to Scorpinator and sent it along with Kay Nine and Blaster back to the nearest Horde camp. I wanted one last look over the place before I left, that’s when I saw it! A miniature Titan Power Core! Oh, come on, no one needs this surely…I grabbed the core and as I did alarms began to blaze!\n\nCrud! I thought as I picked the core up, mechanical growls could be heard from all around me. And then they appeared, mechanical cats and dogs way bigger than me…with glowing eyes and sharp teeth. “Erm…Easy guys I am just gonna take this core and be on my way!” As I moved the core closer to my bag the growls became louder! Screw it, I thought. I grabbed Bandit put him on my shoulders, pocketed the core and ran…ran as fast as I could…ran so fast I didn’t even stop until I ran straight into a Horde camp.\n\nWhen I got back to Azshara, where I had left my Mech before this “epic” adventure, I quickly replaced all the gears and noticed that these were far superior to the previous ones, they moved together a lot smoother and cleaner. As I was replacing the gears, I also noticed power cords that ran to the feet. Holy crap! This Mech…it must be capable of Flight! I connected all the power cords I found into a simple power distribution board, that I had found quite sometime ago but never found a use for, I placed the Titan Power Core into the centre of the Mech and connected it to the board. I jumped into the Mech and pressed the ignition button. Success! The Mech walked without any issues and the flight engines in the feet they worked, ok they only would work for a short amount of time before the warning alarm would sound and then the Titan Power Core would shut off…but who cares for now! \n\n{h3}Week 3{/h3}\nWeapons! What’s the point of having an awesome Mech and having nothing that can go Boom! I ain’t no weaponsmith or anything…so making them is out of the question, finding stuff is what I’m good at though! And I know where there are loads of Canons, Mortars, Guns…everything, a place no one dares go…The Undercity, well more specifically outside.\n\nI journeyed to where the great battle took place, well to the outskirts of course I’m not stupid. With my various Mechanical companions at my side, I knew I could do this. I instructed Blaster and Kay Nine to enter the toxic area and scan for any working (or nearly working) weapons. After a wait of a few hours (I swear those two probably got lost in the ruins) they came back to me and reported of several weapons that could be salvaged. “Great!” I thought as I rubbed my hands together, I ordered Scorpinator to follow them both back in and salvage whatever it could and bring it back to me. \n\nThree hours! Three frick’n hours I waited. When they emerged, I saw the goodies they had found; two large canons, one long-distance mortar canon, four rocket launchers and two rapid firing guns. I thought I would get some strange looks as I travelled with such strange cargo, but no one seemed to notice nor care! \n\nWhen I eventually got back to Azshara, where I had left my Mech, I spent quite sometime inspecting each of the weapons to check they were in some kinda working order. Everything was in working order, except one of the guns which seemed to be jammed and wouldn’t fire…ah well! I spent most of the evening attaching the weapons to the Mech and wiring them directly to the Titan power core. On the back of the Mech I attached to two large canons, the long-distance mortar I placed directly in the middle of the back and the only working gun I attached to its left shoulder. As for the rockets I attached two launchers to each of its forearms. I stepped back and admired my work, sure the Mech was still missing its hull plating so a lot of the insides were exposed but man…it looked so bad ass! \n\nI hopped in my Mech, pressed the various buttons and switches to activate the systems and smiled as each of the new guns came online. “ERROR, ERROR” flashed on a small screen “UNSTABLE POWER OVERLOAD!”, that’s not good I thought to myself and pressed buttons to shutdown the Mech. “SHUTDOWN ERROR!” No…No…NO! This is NOT good, I thought as I jumped off the Mech and frantically pulled all the wiring from the Titan core. I looked at my various companions and yelled at them “Get the frick outta here now guys!”, they all scampered away to a nearby cave. I continued to rip all the wires from the core, but it was too late. The core began to glow brighter and brighter, it was going to explode! I grabbed the core with my bare hands and yelled as the core burnt my hands, I ran as fast as I could to the nearby shore and threw the core with all my strength into the water and ran back to my Mech and hid behind it. Nothing happened…No earth shattering kaboom, no nothing. I stood up and dusted myself down and blew on my burnt hands “What the frick…where’s the Ka…” as I spoke there was a very loud explosion that sent water shooting into the air and knocked me right on my butt! I inspected my Mech and sighed “looks like I need a new power core…” \n\n{h3}Week 4{/h3}\nPower cores don’t just grow on trees and the last one I found by sheer luck. I could go back to the same scrapheap and see if get lucky again…or I could make a core, how hard could it be? I have lots of scraps of metal and junk, surely I can make SOMETHING from all that. I headed back to the cave in Azshara where I had been storing all my stuff. I searched through all the boxes and gathered everything I thought would be useful and I also made myself a sandwich because ya can’t science on an empty stomach! As I ate my sandwich, Cheese and some kinda Fish in case you are wondering, I suddenly remembered. “Azerite!” I had stashed away a nice supply of Azerite from when this whole war started, I had done a few experiments but nothing too crazy. I searched towards the back of the cave and I found it, the large metal box I had stored my Azerite in. One very large Azerite Crystal and six relatively small shards. Perfect!\n\nI sat down with my box of scraps, wires and Azerite and began to think. Azerite is unstable when used improperly, it is also highly explosive…great care will need to be taken if I am to make a working core. I took my hammer and hit the large Azerite Crystal hard, nah I’m kidding! I took some pieces of metal and bent it into a circular shape, placed the small shards on top and wrapped a combination of Copper, Gold and Trillium wires around each piece of Azerite and connected a variety of switches in between the pieces. So why did I do this? Basically, I arranged it this way so the Mech would use one shard first and then as it needs more power the switches would trigger connecting the second shard, then the third etc. Pretty amazing right? So, what was I gonna do about the larger Azerite Crystal? Well, I attached a few pieces of metal to the bottom to form a base, and connected a variety of wires close to the Azerite and then added a few gears to the bottom. Why did I do this? Simple really, what will happen is when I need more power the gears will activate and press the wiring directly onto the larger Azerite Crystal and begin to draw power and when I don’t need more power the wires will retract back a bit. Aint Goblin science grand! \n\nI grabbed the Dual Azerite core system and ran to my Mech. I giggled as I wired everything up and I also attached a small rocket to the bottom of the new core, so if ever an overload happened again, I could eject the core. It didn’t take too long to wire everything up, no where near as long as before. I jumped in my Mech and pressed all the buttons to bring it online and checked the status lights and screen. Everything was green! Meaning everything was AWESOME! I giggled with so much glee as I ran around Azshara in my Mech…I should have been looking where I was going as I bumped right into a very large Naga army! I totally forgot those buttheads still hang around here…\n\nI pressed the buttons to engage the flight system and flew up in the air and I was about to fly away…when I thought “Maybe it’s time to test the Weapons!”. I giggled more as I pressed the buttons to bring the weapons online. “ERROR…ERROR!” not again! The Mech suddenly shut down while I was in the air! Oh crap…The Mech fell as I frantically hit every button which did NOTHING!  I was so mad that I hit my head hard against the controls, which caused everything to come back online and the weapons to become active! “Hell yea…”, I breathed in deeply and flew down close to the Naga and before I fired a single shot, I did what anyone would do at a time like this…I turned on my Goblin Radio and blasted out some tunes! My Mech flew all around the Naga, firing off missiles in every direction and the gun made a great sound as it shot at all the Naga in my way. I flew back to my cave in Azshara and cackled like crazy…I had just built an Azerite core…in a cave…with a box of scraps.\n\n{h3}Week 5{/h3}\nSo, this Mech needs a lot of metal and I mean a lot…we ain’t talkin’ one or two sheets of metal! We are talkin’ like err I dunno exactly! I have been collecting a few scraps of metal here and there on my travels and I have been erm…”salvaging” metal from some of the Horde structures but it still isn’t going to be enough. Oh, so yea if you see any Horde buildings or anything missing large pieces of metal, it wasn’t me ok? \n\nI was walking around Orgrimmar when suddenly it hit me! No really, a large sheet of metal hit me…hurt really bad and knocked me off my feet. When I eventually got back onto my feet, a peon was apologising to me and asked me if I knew where the foreman wanted the metal delivered to. I looked to see several peons carrying metal sheets under their arms. “Of course I know! I am a Goblin and an engineer for the Horde, the foreman wants the metal delivered to a small cave in Azshara”, yea so I lied to some peons but ya know I am part of the Horde so technically them giving me the metal is helping the Horde as a whole. \n\nAfter the peons finished delivering the metal, I carefully counted how many sheets I had and combining it with the parts I had salvaged I calculated I had enough to finish fixing up the external and internal plating of the Mech…I just had no idea how I would get all this metal welded onto the Mech. I sought advice from a Blackrock Orc who told me that welding metals on a large scale is easy using machinery and conveyor belts, “well that’s just great…but I don’t have any of that!” I yelled at him. He shrugged at me and said that a fire mage could probably weld the metals together, I smiled as I knew a certain mage who owed me a few favours. \n\nI met my mage friend in my small cave and told him exactly what he needed to do. While he worked on welding the sheets of metals together, I sorted through the scraps of metals and ores that I had gathered. I had a few chunks of gold and titanium and I had a genius of an idea I could use these to make an alloy that I could cover vital parts and joints in which will help with heat management! I am so gosh damn smart when I need to be! I placed the chunks into a pot and told the mage to superheat the pot, the chunks of metal and the pot melted and oozed onto the floor…well I guess that works. With the help of the mage, we managed to get the alloy off the floor and majority of the welding had been completed. \n\n“Here take this hammer, and help me bend the metals into shape!”, the mage promptly threw the hammer at my head and stormed out. Fine, I will do it myself…can’t be that hard. CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, was the sound that could be heard throughout my cave as I hammered all the metal sheets into various bends and shapes to fit better onto my Mech. After what must have been a good few days, all the metals were formed into the right shapes and I began to place them onto the Mech’s body. Gold-Titanium alloy was used to re-enforce the joints, to cover parts of the guns and canons and around the Azerite core. I borrowed a welding torch from one of the Blackrock Orcs, well ok borrowed without asking…whatever. I welded the sheets of metals onto the mech as best as I could ensuring they were bonded to the Mech and wouldn’t fall off. After a full week of work my Mech finally had hull plating of shiny new metal, it was starting to look even more badass now! Just needs a coat of paint and some fine tuning and it will be done!\n\n{h3}The Final Week{/h3}\nSo, yea, I may have put finishing my Mech on the back burner as they say…But hey! I had so much crap going on lately! There is a War going on ya know, well if you didn’t know then wow you must live in a cave with your fingers in your ears or somethin’! \n\nAnyways, Gazlowe came to me and asked for my help in a place called “Mechagon”. I have heard of this place; it’s meant to be a myth…a legend! But all this time its been just off the coast of Kul Tiras, who’d a thunk it! I agreed to help Gazlowe, he just isn’t the kinda Goblin you say no to really. Off to Mechagon I went, with my Mech of course. Man, the stuff I saw in Mechagon…I can’t even begin to tell ya the stuff that’s there, its Engineering heaven! I helped Gazlowe and his team with research, development and other tasks to help the Horde and took my fair share of whatever we found to help with my Mech….What!? No! For once I didn’t steal anything, I was given the OK to take what I needed for my Mech as we have been using it quite a lot in excavating in Mechagon. \n\nThose Robo-Gnomos, the Mechagnomes, kept looking at my Mech and suggest improvements and systems that should be added. I had to keep shooing them away, aint no gnome…even half a gnome touching my Mech! So, with all the stuff I found in Mechagon I vastly improved my Mech. I have added so many improvements its insane. \n\nI added a security system, so only myself or someone I authorise can pilot my Mech, if you get in and you aren’t authorised you get a nice electric shock…ZAP! \n\nMy Mech now has a powerful Self Destruct, just in case I ever get into a situation where I need to use it! Of course I haven’t tested it…what are you dumb!? Anyways to activate it you say the passcode which is….ha! nice try, I aint telling you!\n\nParty Mode is something I just HAD to add. When activated, large speakers from in my Mech will blast music at crazy loud volumes and the lights on it will flash making for a nice little Disco…even in times of War there is ALWAYS time to Party! \n\nThe final thing I did with my Mech in Mechagon was finally paint it. Turns out Mechagon has a painting station, why? Heck if I know! But it was perfect for my needs. I cleaned up my Mech as best as I could and selected the colour I wanted, a nice dark blue. I mixed some small shavings of metal into the paint mix to give it a slight sparkle when light hits it, hey its MY Mech and I want it looking fancy! I sprayed all of the body in this blue paint and painted the weapons and some of the trims in a nice silver colour. The final touch was to add some skulls, because skulls make anything look badass! I had some left-over gold, which I melted down and moulded into some cool looking skull shapes and then welded them the shoulders and body of my Mech (I made 4 in total) \n\nAnd BOOM! My Mech was finally finished! The Alliance…no wait…AZEROTH better watch out for Slacker and her…\n{h2:c}{col:003ba8}\nMechanised \nElectrostatic \nCritical\nHyper \nAttack \nSystem\neXtra Large Robot {/col}{/h2}",
