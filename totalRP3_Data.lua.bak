Each part of her attire almost always appeared polished, neat and pristine. The same notion rang true for her short violet hair, despite barely reaching her shoulders it seemed to reflect light in all the right angles.\n\nHer form spoke of a life in motion, a few love handles here and there failed to cover up the accentuated muscle built up over years of practice. Perhaps, she'd sometimes be mistaken for a boy from behind, until her face came into view and the feminine features blossomed up into full bloom. Kind, almond-shaped eyes regarded her surroundings with a sense of purpose. The petite nose, high cheek bones and lips that seemed stuck in a pursed pout all betrayed the story of the soldier she strived to be and spoke instead of the girl she was beneath.{/p}{/col}",

Trautfizzle{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-TheMotherlode:256:256}\n{h2:c}Profile By Skinkzey Nutwrencher{/h2}\n{h3:c}(Sponsored and edited by Jastor Trautfizzle){/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}Appearance{/h1}\n\nJastor Trautfizzle has changed over the years. His eyes were once red, his body lean and athletic from spending hours at work in his doctors surgery, and after a time where his eyes were green and his body less than athletic, it seems that life with the Bilgewater Battalion has given him muscle to match his bulk and he's even made consciencous effort to draw away from corruption. Aside from his eyes, his head seems to have taken the brunt of the toll which comes from dabbling in the fel, his face being more wrinkled and what was once a full head of hair having fled the top of his head, forming into sideburns which he struggles to keep in check. \n\nHowever, concerning his fashion sense <The next part seems to have been edited heavily> Jastor is a pioneer in good fashion sense, from his black battle ensemble with felforge ventilation to the finery which he wears when interacting with other important people, or attending fanciful functions, the problems brought about by AGING seem to slip away thanks to the Doctors impeccable style choices.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\BlackMarket\\BlackMarketSign:256:128}\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-WorkshopHorde:512:256}\n\nI come from humble beginnings. Back on Kezan I lead the simple life of a Doctor after I graduated from Crapopolis U. I lived in Bilgewater Port out of my very own surgery with my family, who I unfortunately had to sell to the insurance company so that I could get tickets aboard Gallywixes Pleasure Yacht because Mount Kajaro went and blew its top whilst I was operating.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-LostIsles:512:256}\n\nHere's a holiday snap I took of the Lost Isles, ok so it was more of a traumatizing shipwreck in which I was attacked by wild animals, almost zombified by pygmies and temporarily enslaved by the Trade Prince but I got to say, the island was beautful. Until it got melted by another volcano...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n\nFor a while after the Lost Isles fiasco, I decided following the Trade Prince who had just enslaved me a week or so ago wasn't really for me. So I ran away with the Darkmoon Faire and learnt myself some warlockery. At first it was just an act, pull the imp out of a tophat, saw a voidwalker in two, but then it became something else, it became a -passion-.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Azshara:512:256}\n\nI've ended up saddled with the Bilgewater Cartel, again. It turns out that carnies don't take kindly to my response to their FALSE accusations being to give them the old finger and fly off in their dirigible. Of course they didn't really expect a guy who was once a fully qualified doctor (I still am by the way), to roll up dressed as a mad scientist. So they assigned me somewhere, let's just say my time in Azshara was short lived as it turns out 'they don't want their lumber turned into charcoal', ingrates...\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Felwood:512:256}\n\nWhere did I end up? Felwood of course, where else would a Goblin warlock of my talents end up but in the back end of nowhere surrounded by the remnants of a once great empire of treehuggers and hippies, hidden away from the rest of the world to do my work.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-Tanaan-FelForge:256:128}\n\nBut don't you worry, ladies and gentlemen, the good old doctor still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and in this little pocket of fel infested paradise, my final trick is already in the making...",

She went on a pilgrimage across the entirety of Azeroth's plains to spread her teachings to the impoverished, be them Horde, Alliance or neutral. She had no standing with any faction, instead a self-disciplined helper of the people.\n\nHearing about a particular group of Sin'dorei exiles, Inerith sought once more to help those that others would turn their backs on, either unaware or unflinching at the dangers that lay ahead. Needless to say, she found them.\n\nIn the ultimate case of \"Wrong place, wrong time\" Inerith was transformed alongside the other outcasts into a Ren'dorei, a void elf. Those that once loved her now scorned her, she was berated as a traitor to her people and despised by many that she once helped in her past years. Following her new people, she and the void elves pledged their allegiance to the Alliance.\n\nNow a master of the void, Inerith mixes her new abilities with that of her monk training to become a formidable foe and advantageous ally, accepting contracts to hunt down and capture or kill bounties without fail. Her success was almost unparelleled in this new venture, and she grew tough and resilient as a consequence. Her speed in which she got the dirty jobs done caused the other bounty hunters to nickname her \"Inherit\" for inheriting their sought after fortunes.{/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:83419f}Appearance and Equipment{/col}{/h2}\n{h3}Her body is lithe and athletic, where it can be seen. Usually sporting dark leather armour and always masked. Her true face remains a mystery to many, even those that may have known her before she changed. Her eyes are a deathly pale blue, and her hair is cut short with a few tendrils occasionally twitching within the cut locks.\n\nWeaponry is oftentimes seemingly lacking, but she is able to summon a pair of void infused warglaives from her rifts at a moment's notice. Her armour is dotted with various throwing stars and knives, and when she's on a mission for a bounty usually carries a pair of sharp katanas, also void infused.\n\nSomething about her always seems guarded, to the point where even the clothes she considers to be \"casual\" includes armour and weaponry. If ever seen in these clothes, there is a noticeable scar on her lower back, to the left of her spine. It looks far deeper cut than any of her other scars.{/h3}\n\n",

Came to Azeroth along with other orcs back during First war. Because of a certain incident, before Orgrim Doomhammer's rise to power, he fled the Horde to live as a Hermit travelling across Azeroth. Rejoined the Horde during the founding of Orgrimmar after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits.\n\nConsidered more gentle and cosiderate than most orcs, Still values Honor and strenght. His wolf is always somewhere nearby.\nWidower with sons all over the place.\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}{icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nKoruz became part of the leadership of Darkheart company. Nearing the end of the last campaign he died attempting to save his friends. Recently came back after journeying through Shadowlands.\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2}{icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is an Older orc, a fact that isnt reflected in his appearance, betrayed only by the silver color of his hair. said hair is lenghty, tied into various braids, and a ponytail to ensure it won't be a problem in combat. his beard is also quite long, and braided aswell. His physique is quite impressive on it's own, even for an orc, without even mentioning his age, leaving the wonder of how he looked when he was younger. various scars adorn his body, left by anything starting from beasts, through enemy warriors, and otherwordly creatures. his body is also adorned in tatoo's, which on first glance look like typical Burning blade marks, but in fact serve as runes, that are able to protect Koruz from harmfull magical effects of magics, with void and light magic remaining exception, which although still slightly protected from, remains quite vulnerable to. his expressions tend to be a bit dimmed down, remaining mostly calm in all situations.\n\n{h2:c}Equipment{/h2}{icon:spell_warrior_sharpenblade:25}\n\nKoruz's equipment is mostly simply, resembling a typical blademaster's attire. fine quality leather gloves with bronze vembraces, long kilt woven from strong thread with few steel plates attached, and a double belt with sacks attached to hold it up. Padded leather belts crossing on his chest and tied around his biceps for a bit of extra protection, but mainly because of the pouches on said belts for exttra carry space. otherwise he wears no chestplate as to not limit his movements, spare cloth bandages covering parts of his chest and arms, for unknown reasons. His boots are also made from strong leather, with steel tips and few spikes. His most prized possesion is his blade, that to many remains mystery. Most often his blade look quite simplistic, it's long and slick, but still tough and sturdy. It widens at the end with a ring being attached at the end containing various trophies and trinkets. what is unusual about it is it's blue glow, and slightly colder and spiritual aura.\nAfter coming back from his unfortunate journey through shadowlands, his blade now shifts between that and the other apperance. That other appearance looks like a runeblade, similarly built to the other one, with it's tip resembling a guillotine. adorned with various runes, and a skull with dark steel plates. the blade emanates a sickly green aura that seeps around like a miasma. Those who look upon that blade tend to feel unnatural fear, and those of stronger spirit feel discomfort.\n",

This would keep the young orc busy for a time, and for a while content. But like all mundane occupations, dreariness would set in. Resentment would fall in, soon he would feel the better amongst his menial peon peers. \nThe wake of the fourth war would bring all but a halt to intercontinental trade. Due to the cities proximity and access to the capital, making it a center port for an invasion. The once booming commerce of the neutral city came to grinding downturn. \nThis did not deter Golgak, who believed he would be destined for more than a mere deckhand. In a way the Orc believed this was a sign. A sign to search for a bigger, better destiny. With his trusty coin bag in hand, and few necessary valuables he needs. Golgak trekked all the way to the capital Orgrimmar, in hopes of finding an occupation that suits his ‘worth’. \n\n\n{/col}",

Normally it exhibits only a dull glow but in the midst of fierce spellcasting, it glows brighter, even sending out small sparks of energy on occasion.\n\nHer robes seem to be made from a very high quality matieral, comfortable, yet durable to withstand one or two blows, but that's all. Her staff has a robust design, with a hint of a frost enchantment to it and a core of amber in the center. Made from a metal, it is presumably strong enough to serve as a melee weapon in the desperate times.\n\nHer expression is usually passive, though sometimes curious, such is the nature of most magi. As you'd expect from the majority of blood elf maidens, her physical appearance is that of beauty, which ironically makes her rather plain when standing besides her kin. Her eyes are her most charming feature, always looking about, searching or examining the next mystery. When she speaks, her tone is typically a light one, though it harbors an undertone of confidence.\n",

This dream however, came into conflict with her personal values. Teya felt that Garrosh Hellscream was too barbaric, and after hearing the horrific events of the bombing of Theramore, she felt she was at odds with the Horde, and after a battle with an unruly Garrosh apologist, Teya left her home in Orgrimmar.\n\nTeya's life became very nomadic, exploring all the corners of the isle of Kalimdor, training against whoever offered a duel. Her life became solely focused on her training, rarely taking reprieve in the beautiful scenery, hearing the tyranny of Garrosh occasionally from the citizens of the towns she passed through, fuelling her rage, and increasing the harshness of her self imposed training.\n\nReturning to Orgrimmar months later to the mistreatment of Trolls and the slavery of Tauren, Teya looked for any signs of resistance against the Orcish supremacy regime, and found plenty of it. Joining ranks with the likes of Lorthemar Theron and Vol'jin, as well as the Alliance in the siege of Orgrimmar, Teya fought against the Iron Juggernaut, and after a long battle, met her death against the might of the great machine.\n\nAfter dying to the Iron Juggernaut, Teya found herself alive once more, at her grave. Lost for words, being greeted by an undead General Nazgrim, offering Teya another chance at life as a knight of the Ebon Blade. Teya accepted and swore fealty to the Lich King, grateful for her one more shot at life, after it was cruelly taken away by the Orcish Horde. ",

She was and still is the favourite child of her family. The little elf loved to secretly pick her father's sword and pretend she's a mighty knight, until one day she didn't knew she was watched carefully by him from afar. And this is when her dance with hevy steel began. It was the only thing that occupied her mind at the time, she was obsessed by slicing open the dummy's cloth bodies. \n\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_offhand_sunwell_d_01:25}{/h1}\n{h3:c}Blood Knight:{/h3}\nThanks to her father's acquaintance with Astalor Bloodsworn (a master magi) and his help with the imprisonment of the naaru M'uru under Silvermoon, Elfora became a member of the Blood Knight order alongside her father couple of years ago. When she drained power straight from the naaru, she received a variety of light-based abilities aside from that of martial prowess, but after his death and the restoration of the Sunwell, the closer she is to her homelands, the more powerful her abilities are. \n- During Legion, she followed Lady Liadrin and helped with the other Blood Knights in the rebellion of the Highbourne in Suramar. \n- In the Fourth War, she fought in Arathi Highlands during the Battle for Stormgrade.\n\n{h1:c}Currently:{/h1}\nElfora is back in her homeland, putting aside her missions with the paladins of the Blood Knights order, because of a recent theft in her family home. She's trying to help her family resolve the case and put justice to whoever wishes to cause them harm. \n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-horde-BristlingPower:256:128}",

In this state she mostly just tries to get up to people and demand affection by barking or just.. sitting there.. as if her brain had melted and the only thing that remained was 5% of her elf self and 5% of her canine self\n\nThings she likes in this form: Being patted, being called a good girl, getting any sort of physical affection, not talking, barking, drooling, being hugged, rubbing up to peopl and getting treats.\n\n\n\n\n\n{/col}{/h3}\n\n",

Causing a small wobble with each step she takes! Her face is clean, with makeup and a few freckles. Several golden, gem-encrusted piercings in both her ears and nose. Curly, soft, purple hair sprouts from her head, reaching her shoulders but usually kept up in tails or a bun. \nInquisitive and curious she seems to always be on a mission, a quest to learn something new or plotting a scheme! And with her arcane powers she hasn't met any big obstacles yet. Perhaps that is to change?{/col}{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TheInnKeepersDaughter:512:256}\n{h3:c}{col:e280ff}After extensive and methodical planning, Minph managed to pull off a crazy coup on her family's ruling Elders. Removing them from their positions of power and placing herself in their stead. It was not without its complications, but Minph has emerged stronger than before now looking to clean up the dark shadow cast by her family while also looking to the future from a new perspective. Where will she go from here?{/col}{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-mage-cover:256:256}",

I specialize in savin, documentin an healin our little friends, the animals of Azeroth (though some of dem not be little).\n\nWhen ya come across animals ya gotta be careful, mon. Some not be likin if ya be runnin around on their turf bein all loud an aggressive-lookin. That why some of dem be attackin you on spot. But they not be bad, just angry. Best back off an come back when dey be more understandin.",

He woke up some hours after the ambush in the shrouded hollow with only 2 of the group members in cages next to him. A first instinct to break free was quickly diminished as Jaigro saw a handful of guards coming closer and he was noticed that he was awake. Within the following week, as he saw the aggressive acts of the Sethrak on newly a captured Vulpera warrior, he heard rumbling acts of earth movements down way of the entrance of the cave and seconds later an orc came running in, using magic to shift the earth around the Sethrak guards to throw them down with an act of lightning to knock them out afterward. Amazed, Jaigro broke free of the cage he was in and quickly thanked the orc who also freed the other Vulpera in the cave. The orc asked him to join his group and free the rest of the Vulpera in the area and of course, Jaigro agreed with a smile and followed the orc towards the exit of the cave. “I didn’t expect anyone other than Sethrak until I would see my end, why are you here in Vol’dun stranger?”. “I am looking for a female Zandalari guard, I came with here to Vol’dun to look for someone, but we got struck down by the Sethrak”.|r",

One of them being one of her closest friends, a human concubine named Carys. This lead Nidarosis, whom had little to no previous skill to go through intensive training to be allowed into the Demon hunter training. The risk of death during her training and transformation was high, but her determination and help from the illidari pushed her through many defeats and serious injuries. Though she is far from the strongest Demon Hunter, her goal was to be just strong enough to be able to protect her newfound family against the threats of Azeroth.{/p}\n{p:c}Now that Sargeras is imprisoned, she feels a bit lost as to where she belongs.

She also relies quite heavily on physical contact to show trust, things like a friendly pat on the back or shoulder, handshakes, hugs and sometimes even some light massaging.\n\nArra tries more often than not to find more diplomatic solutions to conflict first as she is not a skilled fighter even with her magic’s and relies more on words or manipulation to survive, something she picked up from her old master.\n\nDespite her kind nature Arra does carry some darker thoughts with her due to her losing her family and being mentally abused as a slave. Having been left powerless to protect her family from death and enslavement and then being manipulated and betrayed by her supposed caretaker has left Arra with an inferiority complex that she constantly tumbles with, causing her to seek power in any form that she thinks she can control and takes comments about her abilities to heart. Due to her lack of skill in combat however Arra is more often than not beaten into a pulp reinforcing the idea that she needs more power, not only to defend herself but more importantly to protect those close to her. \n\nThis frustration can sometimes boil over and Arra’s magic runs wild often seen as bluish shadows surrounding her entire body. In this state her personality grows more choleric and her words are filled with anger and frustration and she can at times even sound mocking. Though this state doesn’t affect Arra’s performance in battle much it does make her more aggressive and seemingly more confident in her abilities. This is at the same time her biggest weakness as she lets her emotions take over her otherwise calm judgement. \n\n",

						["TX"] = "\n{h2:c}Backstory{/h2}\n\n\nArra’s caravan was attacked by Sethrak and most of its members were killed or sold as slaves. Arra herself was sold to a wealthy Sethrak woman who saw her as an object of value, a value that could be increased with proper care and maintenance. She gave Arra clothes, food and a place to sleep and in turn Arra would be her servant, though she didn’t say exactly how Arra would serve her at first only that she had to follow her commands.\n\n\nThe first few weeks Arra’s new mistress helped her regain her strength as the Vulpera was very weak from her time in the harsh conditions of the slave pens. Though she was uncertain what her mistress’s motives were Arra wouldn’t deny herself food that was served to her on a platter, even if it was from a Sethrak. Soon enough Arra’s strength returned and not long after her life as a servant began proper.\n\n\nFirst she was told and taught to do simple things like cleaning and cooking. Cleaning was simple enough raging from dusting to scrubbing floors but cooking proved to be a bit of a challenge for Arra as she was so used to barely scraping by when it came to food out in the dunes, now she had to make food for Sethrak and had a lot more ingredients, fresh ingredients on top of that to work with. But with hard work she eventually got accustomed to this change and became a decent chef.\n\n\nNext up on the list was proper hygiene something that wasn’t exactly a foreign concept to Arra but the best she had gotten before was perhaps a dip in an oasis if she was really lucky, Now she was told to bathe in hot water, use different oils and sometimes different flowers that made her fur smooth and smell of floral. This according to her mistress was the most important thing Arra had to do every day before anything else as how she looked was reflected by her owner’s wealth.\n \nThis cleaning routine is something Arra is still doing every day even after getting her freedom back as it has more or less have become ingrained into her mind and she can become very uneasy if she hasn’t washed herself in a while.\n\n\nLastly Arra’s mistress taught her how to entertain, primarily through exotic dance but also music as both tend to be used together. While she was very uncomfortable with the idea at first dancing in general became something Arra enjoyed exotic or not.\n\n\nThis was Arra’s status que for a while spending most of her days serving her mistress in whatever way she saw fit and even though Arra missed her family and freedom she had seen how cruel the Sethrak commonly was towards her people, treating them as “pets” or working them to death so to ensure her own survival she did as she was told. \n\n\nSometime later however Arra found out why her mistress had treated her so well and taught her these things. She was an investment, a pretty doll to be toyed and played with and something her mistress planned to sell off to the highest bidder either as a plaything or to someone who bred her kind for more slaves. It was at that moment Arra realized how brainwashed she had become, she had blindly been serving initially out of fear but later in the hopes that her mistress was a good person, but there was no love or kindness behind her actions only greed. But she was the only person Arra had left. \n\n\nFortunately the Horde arrived in Vol’dun and freed the Vulpera from the Sethrak’s oppression before her mistress plan could come to fruition, and seeing her world of wealth crumble before her very eyes broke her down completely. Despite feeling betrayed and now mentally abused by her owner Arra couldn’t bring herself to harm her mistress as she owed her life to the snake woman despite the ulterior motives she had for her actions. Telling her now former owner to get out and run to safety with the rest of the upper class citizens Arra grabbed her mistress’s old Serpent staff and fled during the ensuing battle. \n\n\nSometime later Arra caught word that some of her people had begun to leave Vol’dun to join the Horde as thanks for their help. She joined up with one of the many caravans that was traveling towards Kalimdor and the capital city of the Horde. Ogrimmar. \n\n\n{h2:c}Current Events{/h2}\n\n{h3}Chapter One{/h3}\n\nShortly after arriving in Ogrimmar Arra met a group of fellow Vulpera calling themselves the Southwind Nomads who invited her to join them. Though initially unsure of what use she would be to them Arra soon found her place within the group as one of their mystics and traveled with them for a while. Their time mostly spent exploring and traveling to different cities and marketplaces, selling things they made themselves or found during their travels. \n\nUnfortunately the group eventually dissolved and Arra once again found herself alone looking for some sort of purpose or use for her skills.\n\n\n\n{h3}Chapter Two{/h3}\n\nAfter about a month of looking around in Ogrimmar Arra ran into someone that offered to teach her how to improve her magical abilities along with work that would earn her some decent coin in the meantime. Arra accepted the offer and signed a contract with the undead warlock and was scolded by them shortly after for signing without reading the contents of it. \n\nIn the weeks that followed Arra worked for the company her new teacher was a part of, a company mainly run by goblins called the Copper Street Solutions but she also fund fellow Vulpera and other races within the company. The company itself focused mainly on working as hitmen, deliverers of different goods, explores, but Arra found out later that the company leaned a little on the criminal spectrum as well as they had to do some dirty work from time to time. Arra initially helped the company out because her teacher told her to as that was a part of their contract and in return she would be taught the ways of magic starting with shadow magic as she had experience with that. But she eventually grew quite fond of the members of the company during their many missions. \n\nEverything was well for a few weeks  and Arra’s days consisted mostly of working for the Copper Streets and studying under her new master, but her studies was abruptly put on hold when her teacher got accused of having a contract with a demon lord and got banished from Ogrimmar and eventually a bounty was put on his head.\nStill Arra was able to keep in contact with her teacher trough the grimoire he had given her and her studies continued outside any of the horde capitals. \n\nUnfortunately it was not meant to last and Arra’s teacher was hunted down and killed forcing Arra to continue her studies on her own, and even though she enjoyed her time with the Copper Street Solutions Arra ultimatly decided to take her leave from the company feeling that she had gotten enough experience to handle herself.\n ",

The only other one in his face is a bright (now healed) gash where his nose right was torn out.\n\nPekun's ear-cuff is concealing a sizable hole where a chunk is missing from his right ear.

But he's fiercely loyal to his friends and will go through hell and high water to defend them; be it against physical harm or merely verbal offences.\n\nLike many goblins, what Pekun lacks in physical size and strength, he makes up for with his ingenuity. He loves to tinker, especially when faced with a problem that needs to be overcome.

Her hair is {col:d3d89a}bleached{/col} and well kept, somehow not having lost its thickness from the many chemical washings its gone through. It naturally steals one's eyes and lets them drift further across her button nose, something which she has no doubt had a fair few tries at working on, as well as her pleasant, {col:873a8e}pink stare.{/col} Her brows have been picked and finely treated to perfection, arching just between that awful point of constant surprise, and natural thickness. A constant pout adorns her lips, glossy with make-up as she often taps the thick pillows together, making soft little 'pop' noises as she thinks to herself. However hard she might try to hide it, her smiles always curve into toothy grins, betraying the fine gap between her front teeth, and the source of her lisp.\n\nA slender neck slopes down to a pair of slim shoulders. Often confined by an either far too well tailored top, or perhaps one that's purposefully set a bit too tight, is {col:ec66e5}Kitty's{/col} main moneymakers. Large and defiant of gravity, she seems quite proud of them! Though, asking her whether they're enhanced or not will probably earn you a few slaps and a proper wailing. A strict, constantly trend-chasing diet keeps her stomach flat and her waist beautifully shown off. Narrowing in nicely before flowing back out into a wide set of hips, while the curve is elegant, the junk in the trunk this goblin has is anything but(t). Filling out her clothes more than enough, she likes to strut it out in too-tight shorts and low-hanging overalls.\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/u1ygcVL.jpg*Art!}\n\n{h1}Personality{/h1}\n{col:ec66e5}Kitty{/col} is outwardly very extroverted, social, and friendly. She easily feels lonely when not around others and finds it hard to pass the time when not being social.

This time has gifted him awkward twitches, nervous ticks bred of distrust and mistreatment that he cannot now shake.\n\nIn his eyes swims a fair amount of story; and more weight than one so young should carry on his shoulders - his right ear has been sliced at the top, the pointed tip of it entirely removed and now resembling a crescent, perhaps a gift bestowed on him for his trade. When the eyepatch is not worn, his right eye appears unmoving and unblinking, lacking a fel glow and shines as if glass. One of the many stories written upon his face is that of the thin sliver of silver that bisects his upper lip, the tale of which is up for much debate and embellishment, but even the most experienced at escaping authorities can fall victim to bottles and bar fights.\n\nLoud and often obnoxious, with his own charm and confidence; Tal is not to everyone's tastes. He often lacks tact which he tries to offset with wit, but hardly ever lacks good intention, even with his own brand of cockiness - the smile he throws around is genuine and one for all, as harmless as anything that hails from Booty Bay.{/col}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-Islands:256:128}\n\n\n\n",

He was a legen among his clan - The burning blade - being one of the advisors the the chieftain. He has few sibling which he scarecely talks about, and also had a wife and dozen children. His wife died before the Orcs journeyed onto Azeroth, and his children now roam the world as adventurers and legends in their own right. Not long after the Orcish invasion, due to a certain incident Koruz went into Exile, becoming a hermit wandering about Azeroth, which is also the reason for his near nonexistant fel taint. However, after hearing of Thrall's and Rexxar's exploits and their attempts to reform the Horde, he made his way back to his former comrades, hoping to forge his honor anew, and make up for the sins of his past.\n\n{h2:c}Current events{/h2} {icon:inv_misc_scrollunrolled01c:25}\n\nThese days Koruz is part of the inner circle of Darkheart company, serving as it's secondary leader. Unfortunately at the end of the last campaign while attempting to save his comrades he was gunned down by a rogue ethereal, resulting in his arrival to the Shadowlands. After some time journeying and battling through the land of the dead, he managed to find a gateway that allowed him to return from the land of the damned.\nAfter his mind being overtaken by a dark presence he was forced to face his old allies in deadly combat, where he managed to expel the intruder from his mind, shattering it in the proccess, becoming a mindless wretch for some time. Not long ago he managed, through secretive means, to both restore his mind, and bring back the strength of his youth\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2} {icon:achievement_character_orc_male_brn:25}\n\nKoruz is considered an elder among his kin, living for quite a long time, he gathered scars and marks across his body. However for an orc his age he is still strong and of good physique, making many wonder how mighty he was in his younger years. Even now not many orc can match his strenght, and fewer can match his skill with the blade. The only thing that truly betrays him to his true age is his hair, as it's unmistakingly silver color stands quite out. Hidden under his bandages and leather straps, in the middle of his chest a medium sized star shaped scar\n\n{h2:c}Personality{/h2}\nKoruz's personality can be strange to some. For most people he may seem rough around the edges, still more accomodating and less aggresive than a normal orc. Speaking in a more rough tone, and preffering to speak as little as nescessary to people he doesen't know. To his fellows and people who he takes pity upon, his personality becomes quite different. His voices smoothens out taking on more of a caring tone, and becomes more soft. His overall demeanor changes that to a caring father.\n\n{h2:c}Experimental{/h2}\n\n5 HP\n1 Mana\n4 Adrenaline\n\nTrait: Garrosh did nothing wrong!\n",

Born in the Hinterlands, he grew up rather lonely and distant of any interaction with anything other than the wildlife and his parents. His knowledge and practical skills in the wilderness proved to be his saviour many times, not only when surviving alone but also when his parents were raped and murdered by a group of Horde trackers who came across their hut. His hate for the Horde ran deep, yet he also had the side which wishes for peace.\n\nAfter the deaths of his parents, Kostrakim felt obliged to join the Alliance military as a Marksman, after basic training his first tour of the military was none other than the Invasion of the Outlands. After storming out from the Portal his battalion took the main bulk of casualties as they pushed towards Honor Hold and broke free from the Portal itself after managing to push back the Legion from their main defenses. This took a toll on Kostrakim, having been supporting the vanguard the fighting was brutal, the screams of the Pit Lords, the brutal sounds and view of men being torn apart by the Legion forces wasn't an easy thing to witness as his first taste of warfare.\n\nWhen the War for the Outlands was won he returned to Stormwind to rest, having been near mortally wounded by a Doomguard near the battle for the Black Temple.\n\nWhen Deathwing struck during the Cataclysm, his favourite place the park, was destroyed, sending him into an even more deeper anger. He prepared himself for wars to come, distancing himself from most of the things he enjoyed in fear of having them taken away. The time eventually came a while later when he could release this anger as the Alliance began mustering soldiers for the Siege of Orgrimmar. Kostrakim was simply delighted to be able to get some revenge, having been removed from the Vanguard for medical reasons relating to his past time in the Outlands, he stayed with the marksmen and supported from a distance, his bolts however still struck just as true from range as his spear would of from close range.\n\nAs the War in Draenor began to heat up, Kostrakim only managed to be posted there for a short while, only having joined the beginning assault in order to gain a foothold in Draenor.\n\nWhen the Legion once again came to Azeroth, Kostrakim felt once again, bound by duty and vengeance to join the war. He was called to duty, his experience being welcomed by all in the Alliance, as were all in such dire times. He took part in the assault on the Broken Shore, having found it to be even worse of a time than the Outlands, bringing up hard memories he wished had stayed buried deep within the depths of his troubled mind. The Death of Varian struck him hard, having fought with him and the rest of the Alliance for such a long time was a catastrophic blow to his mentality and willpower. Kostrakim was dismissed from 'active' duty and posted in Trueshot Lodge, to support the Rangers and help with the expeditions and security of Highmountain, that is until the Horde took the Highmountain Tauren into their fold.\n\nUpon returning to Stormwind, Kostrakim went back to serving his Lord Orokar loyally. Upon hearing of all the issues with the Horde and the chaotic mineral known as Azerite, Kostrakim decided to jump back into his place within the Alliance, throwing himself in as a Recruit within the Sixth Company of the Stormwind Infantry. He was overwhelmed yet happy to be back into the service of the Alliance, the drills and intensity giving him the thrills he wanted once more. Once finishing his training in Northrend he unfortunately failed his Recruitment stages due to medical issues and proceeded to go onto additional training, yet this was short lived.\n\nThe call for war came, within two short hours they were hauled off to Darnassus as the Horde were attacking Ashenvale, one of his favourite places aside Darnassus itself and Lakeshire. The war had begun and Kostrakim had received a few injuries within the first few days, the skirmishes with the Horde were long and painful for both sides, many casualties and injuries floating up to surface after the hard fought skirmishes. Days later, the retreat was given to abandon Ashenvale and most of Darkshore upon arriving at the Grove of the Ancients. He was furious, how could such foolish and cowardly Commanders abandon their positions and doom hundreds of Kal'dorei to die? His loyalty wavers at this point, if it wasn't for Captain Averheim, the commander during that current time, he'd of most likely deserted, returning to his normal ways and perhaps going to the Steamwheedle Cartel, far from the Alliance yet closer to the Horde...  his mind certainly wasn't in the right place.\n\nUpon the final day of the campaign, the Sixth embarked on pushing the Horde back with the rest of the Alliance forces along the Ruins of Auberdine, yet proved to be a failure as they ended up retreating. Upon being told to be a stretcher carrier, Kostrakim charged forth to join up with his comrades, charging the Horde and forcing them to retreat alongside the Alliance. They came under heavy catapult fire and arrow volleys. Kostrakim had to witness the Horde retreating before he himself as well as the Alliance were forced to pull back, taking an arrow in the throat.\n\nIt was seconds before he was in cover as the arrow pierced his neck, narrowly avoiding the chainmail surrounding it. As he floated down the river as his blood connected with the war corrupted waters of the ruins, his memories came to him... his wife... his war filled past, the anger within him.\n\nAll it took was one soldier with a big set of balls.\n\nOne soldier by the name of Jernard Hilde came to try and save the man as he approached his doom at the end of the river, trying his best to save him yet being forced away by the approaching Horde, unable to carry the body due to the mans fatigue.\n\nA healer from the Horde stumbled upon him very shortly after, scouring for survivors no less, yet this would be one of the first who'd change his mind about the -entirety- of the Horde, a Blood Elf Paladin who took a chance on him, even if he did wear the colours of Stormwind, yet she disagreed with all the death as well as the burning of Teldrassil.\n\nDozens of minutes past, he was not only a changed man, but in fact a healed one! Still immensely weak and now having to be left by the Paladin, he crawled his way through the blood soaked mud, making his way up to Lor'danel to find the splinter forces of the Alliance retreating through the portal. None of his comrades to be seen. All he's lost in the past bubbled up from his past memories and flooded into his mind, a broken man he became, deciding to commit himself to a last stand whilst Teldrassil burned behind him. One by one they left through the portal... hearing the sound of ''Last stand'' and ''To the last!''... Yet even those who spoke the very same words left through the portal. He did not see cowards, just people who didn't want to die for nothing. Yet to Kostrakim, this wasn't nothing. It was his -final- last stand to end his personal suffering and pain, the loss of his family and friends in the past as well as his home and most beloved place burning infront of his eyes being taken away -once more- by the Horde.\n\nRoughly an hour passed as he stood there spear in hand, awaiting the Horde to charge into Lor'danel, confused it would take them so long. He knew they could take it whenever they wanted as it was near completely abandoned. A group of Orcs and Sin'dorei made their way into Lor'danel, realising it was completely abandoned the Horde didn't want to trouble themselves it seems. Kostrakim waited at the docks of Lor'danel, watching from a corner post  and awaiting his time to charge. He was ready to charge, slowly creeping up behind the unsuspecting Horde. Yet when they saw him, they didn't draw their weapons... they didn't do anything in fact, they just stared at him in silence, tears seen in the Sin'dorei's eyes, whilst the Orc's watched on with a disgusted look on their face. This came as a huge shock to Kostrakim, all his life he'd dedicated his life to getting vengeance on the Horde, expecting them to only want death and destruction. He lowered his spear, in tears himself as he approached the group cautiously, they still were the enemy after all. They told him it was only the Queen's doings and that they despised her actions. He was struck with confusion and heavy mixed feelings, deciding to return to the Eastern Kingdoms after rowing out to one of the last remaining ships evacuating the few remaining survivors of Tel'drassil... even hearing that the Sun Hawks were saving children.\n\nThings took a turn when he came to Stormwind to rejoin the Sixth, people were confused with how he was alive and he felt he needed to explain as best he could. At first he didn't wish to rejoin, personal vengeance clouding his mind until he realised how happy a few of the Sixth were to see him alive. This motivated him to rejoin them, yet his emotions were all but gone by now.\n\nWeeks went by, yet someone he met changed his life, even if it was for a brief moment. It'd be something he'd remember forever. It was now time to go to Lordaeron, to reclaim what the Alliance lost long ago as well as get their vengeance.\n\nWeeks of fighting in the surrounding area of Tirisfal, from the beach landing, to taking Brill and enduring dozens of skirmishes led Kostrakim to gain more scars as well as enemies and friends on both sides, his loyalty to the Alliance all but fading due to the many who were there. His opinions had been changed of the Horde a bit upon meeting a few of them and seeing the actions of some too, whether it ranged from offering over Alliance bodies, to hating Sylvanas's actions and even trying to desert or provide information to the Alliance. Kostrakim witnessed many of these rebels of Sylvanas be cut down and slaughtered by his fellow Alliance, his distaste for the Alliance now growing as he became more and more neutral, yet throughout all of this, his hate for Sylvanas grew, seeing her and those who would defend her as a 'different' entity to the true Horde...\n\nMonths went by as Kostrakim fought in the area of Arathi, his personal vendetta against Sylvanas's broken Horde not changing. Unfortunately upon a failed attack, Kostrakim was lost in the Vanguard of an assault, being captured as their force was overwhelmed. Having been captured he was as uncooperative as a prisoner can be without being near suicidal. He bode his time for weeks until his loved one could come and help him, his absence upon him not returning to Stormwind giving her nothing but worry. He'd been beaten, half starved and humiliated for months on end, having to spend even more time in a medical bay to recover.\n\nThe time for Darkshore came. Kostrakim wished to join the fight against the Horde. Merciless and bloodlusty, he put aside all neutrality upon seeing the charred ashes of his old home, Teldrassil. Months of fighting took its toll on him, causing him to lose his bearing on who he was.\n\n\n(More to add, been inactive for a while.)",

Still, she is a fierce supporter of the Horde; not for her love for the Horde´s population but for the hatred she carries against humans, who apparently killed her son. She blames much of the misfortune of the Sin'dorei on the humans, considering them racist and careless, rotten behind that bright appearence of honesty and light. Given the chance, she would gladly attack Stormwind or any human cities to make them suffer. \n\nLady Elionor is a magic user and supporter, with vast knowledge in healing magic. her most interesting ability is her mana perception. She is extremelly skilled in this matter, being able to percieve people and to confuse them, attacking their senses altering her rival`s mana to create illusions. Unfortunately, she is not a warrior and she can´t do anything in a physical fight but surrounded by a group of allies, her healing abilities and her illusions make her a powerful force in battle.\n\nGlory to the Sin'dorei!\n\n{img:Interface\\FlavorImages\\BloodElfLogo-small:256:256}\n",

As you look at her for the first time her whole bodylanguage is a meek puppy. She seems skittish and jumpy. For every loud noise you see her quickly look in the direction wence it came. She also seems to be fidgeting with her hands alot.\n\n\n\n{h1}Physical Appearance{/h1}\nShe's not beautiful. Some might consider the plainness of her an appealing attribute but you won't be seeing her on any pin-up calendars ever. \n\nHer face lacks any make-up whatsoever. The skin around her eyes are a darker hue of green than the rest of her face. A few freckles can be found below her eyes. She has a rather small nose for a goblin but has the usual full lips. \n\nA few nothces can be found at her ears. One bit that was torn off, a few snips here and there, but Dotty still wears earrings of all sorts. \n\nHer body is average as well. It has some decent proportions sure and she has a bit of a belly on her. It's mostly covered up in clothes so nothing really stands out about that part of her. \n\nIf you ever were to see her without a shirt on, and, why would you? You would see tattoos inked onto her skin from shoulder to navel. An intricate pattern of which the origin is known only to Dotty and perhaps the person who actually tatood it. \n\n\n\n\n",

Smaller than even the average vixen, he stands at a mere 3’7” (111cm). His body is very petite, seeming far more feminine than masculine, leading many to confuse him for a female, rather than a male.\nThough two things that stand out as larger than average on him are his ears and his tail. His ears are absolutely massive, far bigger than what would be considered ‘average’ among the Vulpera, and they portray a lot of his emotion. Continuous twitching, lowering and flapping of the ears is a very common thing in Thyuno, and alongside his tail, the easiest giveaway on how he might be feeling.\nHis tail, as mentioned, is a little longer than the average Vulpera’s, too. It stretches out as far as the rest of his body (minus the head) combined, and it often betrays his emotions, as well. Wagging, tucking in between his legs – his ears and his tail are full of body language.\nHis very thin and frail body is complemented by his very fluffy dark-gray and white fur with black stripes that he very regularly takes proper care of. He makes sure it is always neatly washed and thoroughly brushed. And it is particularly fluffy on his tail and on his face.\nThyuno’s face is male, but very, very effeminate, thus leading even Vulpera to need to take a second look before being sure. He has a rather long, but delicate snout, with a very, very small nose at the end that constantly seems to sniffle the air, like a bunny. His eyes are always covered with a thin layer of freshly-applied kohl. They’re hazel-coloured, and often appear very sensual in emotion.\nHe prefers to wear dresses and robes that complement his femininity, fully embracing it and being himself, and coupled together with his very soft voice, it is clear that Thyuno is one very small and delicate Vulpera at first glance. But looks can be deceiving, as those who make him their enemy might regret judging a book by its cover.\n{/p}\n\n{h2:c}OTHER USEFUL LINKS{/h2}\n\nCharacter theme 1: {link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxg4C365LbQ*Lorn - Acid Rain} Wonder why?

There was a faint scent of fire carried with it as the night cast its unforgiving and impenetrable veil over everything it touched. Two pairs of luminous eyes seemed exempt from that rule, however, as they gleamed in the dark, carried by two silhouettes that almost seemed to slither, had they not been in such a hurry. They stood next to a wagon which still billowed smoke into the air, making it clear where the scorching scent entwined with the winds. Urgent, but hushed voices could be heard at its entrance.\n    “Hurry!” hissed one of the silhouettes. “Take that foxss and be done with it!”\n    Spitefully, the other replied; “Korthek will have our headsss if we fail to take the otherssss!”\nAs they stared at each other for a brief moment to calculate their next move, looks of anger and defeat are plastered across their faces once they realise that running away is their only option.\nThey fled the scene, but not without a small, unconscious Vulpera kit that trailed behind them. It was clearly being dragged, creating small dents with its paws that were soon smoothened out by the everlasting winds which relentlessly shifted the sands. And as the silhouettes faded into the darkness, there was nothing but the sound of the wind that remained where the commotion occurred.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nInterested in what happens next? This is the beginning of a novella that I am writing called Thyuno Origins. Stay tuned as I will post the link to it here once it's finished - and reading it will be completely free of charge, of course. ^^{/p}",

However naturally curvy she maintains a feminine figure, possibly reinforced by the demon within her, even if a multitude of deep scars cover her arms, shoulders, abdomen and legs.
